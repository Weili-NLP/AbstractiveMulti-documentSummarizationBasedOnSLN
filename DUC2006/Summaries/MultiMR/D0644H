Clinton's plan includes $ 34 billion in tax cuts over five years, $ 39 billion in increased spending over the current fiscal year and projects a record $ 117 billion surplus.
The Clinton budget would : Devote $ 2.7 trillion, or 62 percent of the projected $ 4.4 trillion federal budget surplus over the next 15 years, to rescuing the financially ailing Social Security system.
White House budget director Jack Lew said Clinton's budget blueprint would cut projected debt costs to just 2 cents out of every federal tax dollar in 2014.
Over the next five years, the measure would set aside at least $ 150 billion for tax cuts and the entire $ 1 trillion in projected Social Security surpluses for debt reduction, Republicans said.
 The centerpiece of the Clinton administration's economic policy this year has been a demand that the Republican-controlled Congress forgo tax cuts and set aside the projected federal budget surplus until the nation shores up the Social Security system.
However, if political pressures on lawmakers to use surpluses are too great, the Fed chairman said, he would prefer a tax cut over new spending programs.
President Clinton's final budget projects that the $ 3.7 trillion publicly held portion of the $ 5.7 trillion national debt could be eliminated by 2013, making the government free of debt to the public for the first time since 1835, when Andrew Jackson was president.
