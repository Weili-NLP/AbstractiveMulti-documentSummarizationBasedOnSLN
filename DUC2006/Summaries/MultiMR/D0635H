Texas is one of 38 U.S. states with the death penalty.
When asked about the report Tuesday, Gov. George W. Bush, who appoints the parole board members, said the clemency system has withstood court challenge.
In his five years as governor of Texas, the state has executed far more than any other state.
Bush has lately granted a stay of execution for the first time, for a DNA test.
Bush has never granted a stay of execution, including in the case of Karla Faye Tucker, who was put to death early this year for her part in two pickax murders in Houston.
Then, there is the serious Bush.
Bush has said he supports the death penalty and does n't believe an innocent person has been executed in Texas during his administration.
Since Bush became governor in 1995, the state has executed 143 people, including 32 this year.
Innocent people are almost certainly being killed because of the death penalty.
Bush commuted Lucas sentence to life in prison in 1998, following a recommendation by the state pardons board, after serious questions were raised about whether Lucas committed the murder he was convicted of.
ON THE DEATH PENALTY : Leaving Appeals To Higher Power &QL; Bush has strongly supported the death penalty and he has presided over a record 98 executions as governor, according to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.
