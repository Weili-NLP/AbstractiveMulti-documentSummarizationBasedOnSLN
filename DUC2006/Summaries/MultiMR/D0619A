Gay Republicans want to neuter the platform so that next time they can come in and say homosexual marriage is OK and gays in the military are OK, said Andrea Sheldon, executive director of the Traditional Values Coalition.
As is the case with other contentious social issues such as abortion, the gay rights issue is something of a thorn in the side of Republicans and their presidential hopeful, Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
There's no doubt in my mind there's effort by the Bush camp to send a message, said Rich Tafel, executive director of Log Cabin Republicans, noting that for the first time an openly gay member of Congress, Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., will address the convention.
Still, Tafel said gay Republicans are trying to look past the Republican platform debate to the convention itself and Bush's campaign against Vice President Al Gore.
But he has refused to meet with the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay GOP group.
Unlike Bush, however, McCain met with the Log Cabin Republicans.
Bush spokesman Scott McClellan shed little light on that response, saying Bush refused to meet with the Log Cabin Republicans because they politicize gay issues.
But Kevin Ivers, a spokesman for the Log Cabin Republicans, the country's largest organization for gay Republicans, said despite the Kolbe incident and the platform, the convention was by far the most successful ever for homosexual Republicans.
We are at a turning point in the Republican Party on gay and lesbian issues, Ivers said.
