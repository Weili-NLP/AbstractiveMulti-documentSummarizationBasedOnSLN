The EgyptAir flight crashed Oct. 31 off the Massachusetts island of Nantucket, killing the 217 people on board.
After an examination of the flight data recorder, the cockpit voice recorder, radar data and small amounts of wreckage, Hall said in November that there was no sign of mechanical failure that could have caused the crash.
EgyptAir Flight 990 crashed into the Atlantic off the United States coast shortly after taking off from New York airport on October 31, killing all 217 people on board.
An air traffic control recording released earlier showed no radio transmissions from Flight 990 to controllers or other aircraft in the final minutes before the plane crashed.
Also, information from the flight data recorder released early in the investigation showed the plane's autopilot was switched off before it was put into a steep dive.
Aboard the same plane were 73 family members of the Egyptian victims of the EgyptAir flight 990, a Boeing 767, which crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off the northeastern coast of the U.S. shortly after taking off from John F. Kennedy International Airport on the way to Cairo early Sunday.
The plane's flight data recorder, one of the two Black Boxes, was retrieved early Tuesday and now is under analysis by experts of U.S. National Transportation Safety Board NTSB in Washington.
 Investigators from the United States and Egypt will review part of the flight control system in the tail of Boeing's 767 airplane as part of the investigation into the crash of EgyptAir Flight 990, the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board said Friday.
