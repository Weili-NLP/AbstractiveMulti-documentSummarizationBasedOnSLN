 Spanish pole vaulter Dana Cervantes was tested positive in August for the banned steroid nandrolone, the International Amateur Athletic Federation IAAF said on Wednesday.
 As yet another drug scandal struck the Olympic track and field competition on Wednesday, Marion Jones sprinted for the first time since the public announcement that her husband had tested positive for steroids, easily winning her opening heat in the 200 meters.
Minutes before Jones's heat, the gold medal favorite in the women's hammer throw was told while on the track that she was ineligible to compete because she had failed a drug test for the steroid nandrolone.
Then, last October, the 33-year-old Pippig was suspended by the German athletic federation for failing a routine out-of-competition drug test.
But because the test can not distinguish naturally produced testosterone from ingested testosterone, even a high ratio is no guarantee an athlete has taken testosterone or androstenedione, the latter used by Mark McGwire and legal in baseball but banned by the IAAF.
Anabolic steroids are synthetic substitutes for testosterone, the hormone that directs the body to produce or add male characteristics like increased muscle mass, facial hair and a deep voice.
 Two positive doping tests were announced on Wednesday, just two days before the opening of the Sydney Olympic Games.
According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, up to 13 percent of all high school athletes use anabolic steroids and 40 percent of those athletes believe the illegal drug is not harmful.
