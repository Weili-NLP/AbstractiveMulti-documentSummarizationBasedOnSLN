The national total of seven serious violent and property crimes reported to police around the country was about 12 million in 1998, down 5.4 percent from the previous year and 12 percent from 1989, the FBI said.
Attorney General Janet Reno attributed the decline of crime rate to more police officers on the street, greater partnerships between law enforcement agencies, continued efforts to keep guns away from criminals, and a balanced approach that includes prevention, intervention, punishment and supervision.
The figures make Atlanta's crime rate the highest among U.S. cities of 250,000 or more people.
In the first two weeks of May 1994, for example, there were 120 articles on crimes in the city in The New York Daily News, The New York Post and The New York Times.
Law enforcement officials attribute the continued drop in crime rates to a healthy economy, crime prevention programs, tougher sentences and more police officers on the street.
The report said 44 percent of last year's violent crimes against people were reported to police, compared with 34 percent of property crimes.
In the federal system, repeat offenders get more time, federal prisoners serve about 80 percent of their sentences and there is no parole.
Another possible cause for the crime rate cut is the decline in the nation's crack cocaine problem, which is associated with large increase in violence crime among young people in the 1980s.
