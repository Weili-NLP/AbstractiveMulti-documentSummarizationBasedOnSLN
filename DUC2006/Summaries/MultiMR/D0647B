 The Miami relatives of Elian Gonzales Friday lost what may be their final battle to prevent the boy's return to Cuba.
 The relatives of Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old Cuban boy at the center of an international custody battle, decided Tuesday night to turn the boy over to his father on Wednesday at a meeting here, government officials said on Tuesday night.
In frantic last-minute negotiations, as the Justice Department prepared to order the transfer on Thursday morning in Florida, representatives of the Miami relatives and Juan Miguel Gonzalez, Elian's father, agreed to a meeting in the Washington, D.C., area, the officials said.
The issue seemed headed to a showdown when last week, Elian's father arrived in the United States to retrieve his son from the Miami relatives, who were granted temporary custody until federal authorities ordered that the boy be reunited with his father.
The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service INS ruled that Elian belongs to his father in Cuba, but Elian's Miami relatives insist the boy stay with them in the United States.
The plane took off at Washington Dulles International Airport after the U.S. Supreme Court refused to accept the appeal by Elian relatives in Miami to keep him in the United States.
The boy was soon in the center of a campaign to bring him back to Cuba by his father and relatives in Cuba and to keep him in the United States by his relatives in Miami.
