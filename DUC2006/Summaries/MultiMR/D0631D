 Concorde 4590, you have flames, you have flames behind you, the control tower warned the crew of the plane, which had just lifted off at about 200 mph from Charles de Gaulle airport.
 One month after an Air France Concorde crashed outside Paris, victims relatives gathered Saturday to remember their loved ones near the site where the supersonic jet went down.
Family members were flown in from Germany by Air France, which suspended all Concorde flights immediately after the July 25 crash outside Gonesse, a small town nine miles northeast of Paris.

 French investigators looking into the crash last month of an Air France Concorde said Thursday it was probable that a 16-inch piece of metal found on the runway caused a tire to blow out, sending debris from the tire through fuel tanks and triggering a fire that brought down the plane.
It was the first time the investigators had offered a probable explanation of why the jet caught fire on takeoff and crashed into a hotel north of Paris on July 25, killing 113 people.
French investigators have said they believe that a thin strip of metal fell off the Continental plane, which had taken off on the same runway as the Concorde, and set off the events that caused the Air France jet to burst into flames and crash within minutes after its takeoff.
