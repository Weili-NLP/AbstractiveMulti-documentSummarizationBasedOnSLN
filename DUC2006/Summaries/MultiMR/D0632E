Describing Li's visit to Mongolia in 1994 as important for the smooth development of bilateral relations, Jasray said that the treaty on bilateral friendship and cooperation is functioning as the political and legal basis for bilateral relations.
The Mongolian side appreciated China's policy on good-neighborly ties and China's support for Mongolia as a nuclear-free zone, added Jasray.
He also noted that Mongolia is glad to see the marked development of bilateral economic and trade relations in the past few years, and the smooth development of bilateral economic cooperation, especially China's investment in Mongolia.
China's economic aid to Mongolia has also played an important role in the economic development of Mongolia, according to Jasray.
The Danish foreign minister told Mongolian Prime Minister Mensaihani Enhsaihan that his country would urge the European Union and some other world organizations to give more aid to Mongolia.
It has decided to provide a grant of 27 million U.S. dollars to Mongolia between 1991-1997.
 Chinese President Jiang Zemin met with visiting Mongolian Prime Minister Puntsagiyn Jasray here this afternoon, and they exchanged views on furthering bilateral relations in a friendly conversation.
 France and Britain have both pledged to continue their support for Mongolia's foreign policy and its political and economic reforms, Mongolian President Punsalmaagiyn Ochirbat said here Monday.
 Some international organizations and foreign countries vowed here Tuesday to provide 320 million U.S. dollars in loans and aid to Mongolia to help it overcome economic difficulties and to assist in the transition to a market economy.
