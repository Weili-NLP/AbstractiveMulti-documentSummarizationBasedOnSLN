 The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, July 30 : Now that a former New York City police officer, Francis Livoti, has been convicted in federal court of violating the civil rights of Anthony Baez, the focus of investigation should move to the officers accused of lying on the witness stand to protect Livoti.
The U.S. attorney's office is looking into possible perjury and cover-up charges.
The department must account for police testimony that was not believed in a court of law.
Lundy pleaded guilty to one count of perjury in a U.S. District Court.
The evidence is very clear, said Representative Bill McCollum of Florida, one of the 13 House managers slated to present the case against Clinton in the Senate impeachment trial.
While the House rejected an impeachment article that said Clinton lied in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case, it approved an article that said Clinton lied about many of the same facts before the federal grand jury.
The lie, according to the Starr report and the House Judiciary Committee, is that Clinton repeatedly denied having a sexual relationship with Lewinsky in the civil case.
Clinton's defense, according to his lawyers, is that the definition of sexual relations used in the Jones case did not include oral sex.
At another point in the Jones deposition, Clinton said : I have never had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky.
