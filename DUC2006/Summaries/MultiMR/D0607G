 Workers from a state-run cement factory surrounded government offices in central China for five days to protest a plan to privatize their plant, a rights group reported Monday.
The protesters from Wuhan's Light Auto Works General factory blocked streets for 2Â 1/2 hours before city officials agreed to give them three months of overdue pension payments, the Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China reported.
Li Boyong, a delegate to the on-going 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, said deepening reforms in state-owned enterprises will bring about certain pressure on employment in urban areas in China, but it is within the handling capacity of the society, and is far from touching off any social unrest.
