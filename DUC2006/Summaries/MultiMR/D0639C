 Scientists found no traces of chemical weapons compounds in a Sudanese pharmaceutical plant, which was destroyed in August by U.S. cruise missiles, the New Times said on Tuesday.
Al Shifa pharmaceutical plant in Khartoum was attacked by the United States, alleging that its CIA intelligents had clandestinely collected soil samples from the plant site to find that these samples contained traces of Empta, a precursor used in the production of deadly VX nerve gas.
And Washington decided Saudi exile Osama bin Laden was behind the bombing and the Sudanese plant was used by bin Laden to produce chemical weapons compounds.
But U.S. administration officials dismissed the findings, noting that their soil samples were taken long after the United States obtained its soil from the site and long after the bombing and rains could have dispersed incriminating evidence.
 Virtually the same compound that was found outside a pharmaceutical plant in Sudan and led to last week's US rocket strike was also found in the blood of a man who had been killed by VX nerve gas in an attack by a Japanese cult, a team of scientists reported here Tuesday.
 The United States believed that senior Iraqi scientists were helping to produce elements of the nerve agent VX at a factory in Khartoum that American cruise missiles destroyed last week, administration and intelligence officials said on Monday.
The United States has said a U.N. investigation is unnecessary because U.S. intelligence showed the plant produced chemical weapons.
