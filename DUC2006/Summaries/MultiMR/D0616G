 Russian forces pounded Chechen positions with an artillery barrage on several fronts today, and Russian authorities said they suspect Chechen militants will soon try to launch terrorist attacks.
Although Russian troops have held off mounting a ground attack on the capital, Russia has shown little inclination to negotiate an end to the fighting.
The Chechens have most of the territory in the more heavily populated regions south of the river, though the Russians have made inroads in western Chechnya and have been massing forces along Chechnya's eastern border.
The Defense Ministry said that two of Chechnya's most prominent warlords, Salman Raduyev and Shamil Basayev, were both planning terrorist attacks inside Russia.
The rebels are retreating from the Gudermes and Sunzha districts to mountainous areas in Chechnya under attacks from the federal troops, said a source from the Russian Defense Ministry.
Normal, peaceful life for this part of the Russian population ... will be restored, Col. Gen. Valery Manilov, deputy chief of Russia's general staff, told a news conference in Moscow Thursday, hours after President Vladimir Putin reprimanded officials for lax security in the war-torn region.
 Russian federal forces continued air raids on rebel positions in Chechnya Wednesday as restrictions were imposed in the breakaway republic to prevent rebel attacks during the May holidays.
The military campaign was launched following armed Chechen intrusions into the Daghestan republic and bomb blasts in four apartment buildings that killed some 300 people in Moscow and two other Russian cities.
