Under one part of the 25-year-old Section 8 program, landlords agree to rent their properties to low-income people, who then pay about 30 percent of their income as rent.
The poor must either pay the higher rents or find new housing.
In Massachusetts, there are about 130,000 low-income families living in subsidized housing under a variety of programs, with as many as 100,000 families on waiting lists for affordable housing units, officials said.
Last week, Levy, having become the president of a tiny nonprofit housing organization, helped create the first real estate investment trust, or REIT, to specialize in affordable housing and community development.
Some property owners are dropping out of federal affordable housing subsidy programs in which low-income people pay about 30 percent of their income as rent.
Unlike public housing residents, who live in a closed community, people who receive the vouchers are dispersed throughout the private housing market.
About the only housing program that seems to win new money from Congress is the development of prisons, said Dunlap, noting that Congress has not approved new housing assistance vouchers for low-income families since 1995, when the Republican Party took control of Congress and cut additional housing assistance vouchers from the federal budget.
Despite the call for more affordable housing units from the administration and advocates for fair housing, some people think the federal government should not be in the business of housing to begin with.
