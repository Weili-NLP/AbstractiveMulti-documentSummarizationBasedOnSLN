 Bucking recent changes in Kansas and other states that allow public schools to teach alternative views of human development, the New Mexico Board of Education voted overwhelmingly on Friday to limit the statewide science curriculum to the teaching of evolution.
Creationism holds that a divine being created humans and other species a mere 10,000 years ago, while evolutionists say scientific evidence shows that life began almost 4 billion years ago with simple organisms, from which humans and all other forms of life evolved.
Creationists hailed each of those changes as major victories during a time when the teaching of evolution has enjoyed pre-eminence in most public school districts as a result of a 1987 Supreme Court decision that said states could not compel the teaching of creationism in public schools.
I would n't be here if it were n't for good science, he said.
To him, evolution is none of these things.
But Charles Darwin's theory still faces challenges in the nation's classrooms from increasingly sophisticated creationists, state and local school boards that leave evolution out of science education, and many biology teachers who themselves reject evolution.
Judging from the agitation in the state over evolution, there is evidence she has succeeded : In the beginning, the Kansas Board of Education and the state education commissioner appointed a 27-member committee of science teachers and professors to write new science standards for public schools.
She knew only about evolution.
