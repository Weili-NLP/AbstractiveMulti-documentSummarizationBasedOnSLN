 For a candidate who insists he's too busy being president to campaign, Vladimir Putin is spending a lot of time on the road, running one of the slickest election campaigns Russians have ever seen.
The acting president has the support of about 60 percent of voters, with Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov in second place with 20 percent, opinion polls say.
The candidates platforms are vague, with Putin and his rivals all pledging to ensure economic growth, improve miserable living standards, combat corruption and crime, and restore Russia as a great power.
 Russian acting President, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin will not leave Russia for a visit before the presidential election scheduled for March 26, said a top Kremlin official Tuesday.

 Russian President Boris Yeltsin on Monday announced that he wanted acting Prime Minister Vladimir Putin to succeed him as Russia's next president in next summer elections.
With 96 percent of the vote counted, Russian election officials named Putin, 47, the winner of only the second democratic presidential election in Russia's history with 53 percent.
 Communist Party chief Gennady Zyuganov on Tuesday became the first candidate approved for Russia's March 26 presidential election, though polls show him still far behind acting President Vladimir Putin.
But what kind of man is Putin?
