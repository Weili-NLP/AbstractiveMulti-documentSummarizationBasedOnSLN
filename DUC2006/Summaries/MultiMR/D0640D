 A top Russian official on Monday denied reports that the nation's security service was investigating last month's sinking of a nuclear submarine and had presented its findings to President Vladimir Putin.
Russian officials have speculated that the Kursk collided with another vessel in the Barents Sea, and usually blame an unspecified foreign submarine.
One explanation presumes that the submarine hit a World War II mine, the second is that the Kursk collided with another submarine, and the third is that an explosion took place inside the submarine's torpedo compartment.
The crew has not been in radio contact with rescue ships since the submarine sank.
The summary, based on acoustic recordings and other information gathered by two U.S. submarines and a surface vessel in the Barents at the time, included evidence that U.S. officials have said contradicts assertions by some Russian officials that the Kursk sank after a collision with another submarine or a World War II-era mine.
There was no news Thursday about the 118 men trapped since Saturday at the bottom of the Barents Sea aboard the Kursk, one of the newest and most powerful nuclear submarines in the Russian navy.
 Intensive efforts continued Friday in the Barents Sea to save 118 crew aboard Russia's Kursk nuclear submarine that went down to the seabed last Saturday.
 Russian Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov said Thursday that collision with a big object caused the Kursk nuclear submarine to sink to the bottom of the Barents Sea.
