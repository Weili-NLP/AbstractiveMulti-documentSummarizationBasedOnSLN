For the first time that electronic commerce was measured as a category, online stores captured 2 percent of the book market while independent booksellers continued to lose share, which declined less than one percentage point, to 16.6 percent.
 Five months after Barnes & Noble Inc. rattled the book industry with the seismic announcement of its acquisition of the nation's largest wholesaler, Ingram Book Group, the proposed merger is undergoing intense federal scrutiny and is now being investigated by the California attorney general's office.
Barnes & Noble's sales account for about 14 percent of the consumer book market.
In general, the merger's opponents are worried that the Ingram purchase will give Barnes & Noble access to the sales data of independent competitors or allow it to stock its stores with popular books that might be in short supply while making a competitor like Amazon.com wait for the same title.
 Facing intensifying competition, the nation's trade association for independent booksellers is creating its own national online store, Book Sense, to stave off fierce competition from Amazon.com and Barnesandnoble.com.
Barnes & Noble has about 14 percent of the retail book market.
In 1997, about 25 percent of adult book purchases were made at Barnes & Noble and other chains while just over 17 percent were made at independent stores.
In their two-decades war against chain stores and, more recently, online booksellers, they have shared little beyond Barnes & Noble, Borders, Amazon, the price clubs and a will to survive.
