 National labor talks between Detroit's automakers and the United Auto Workers begin this week in the midst of record-breaking sales that have left General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler AG flush with cash.
GM and the union also will have to resolve the future of the 42,640 UAW members at Delphi Automotive Systems Corp., the big parts unit the automaker divested last month.
The strikes at two parts factories have forced GM to close 26 of its 29 North American assembly plants.
A deal by that point would allow time for the 9,200 striking workers to vote on ratification over the weekend and reopen the struck auto parts factories Monday, the day when GM workers would normally return from the company's regularly scheduled two-week summer shutdown.
The transfer of production to Mexico and other countries has become a focus of the United Automobile Workers strike against GM, which began at a stamping plant in Flint and at the Delphi East factory.
In Mexico, where the strike has idled 23,000 workers at two dozen Delphi plants, Delphi managers have told workers that the union is demanding that GM close its Mexican plants and return its parts production to the United States, said Juan Villafuerte Morales, a union officer representing workers at Delphi's Matamoros factories.
The UAW's deal with Ford also allows the automaker to spin-off its Visteon Automotive Systems, with 23,500 UAW workers, into a separate company.
