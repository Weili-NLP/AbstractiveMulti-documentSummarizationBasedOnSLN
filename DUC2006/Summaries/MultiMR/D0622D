Earlier this month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta and the New York City Health Department said the cause was the mosquito-borne St. Louis virus, which had never been identified in New York City before.
Federal and local medical sleuths did not immediately relate the bird die-off to the human outbreak because West Nile, St. Louis and similar encephalitis viruses generally do not kill birds.
Furthermore, the New York City health department's fact sheets say that, in infected areas, only 1 percent of the mosquitoes actually carried the virus.
Since we are finding West Nile virus in birds in counties well outside of the area originally infected, and many birds are too young to fly far, it is likely that the virus is present throughout New York state, Health Commissioner Antonia C. Novello said.
Last year, the first U.S. case of West Nile virus was reported in late August, and a total of seven people in the New York City area died and 62 were infected.
That's because West Nile virus had not been reported in the United States until August ; in the late summer and fall, 61 cases of severe infection and seven deaths were reported in the New York area, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported.
Health officials have been concerned that infected birds might spread the West Nile virus if they migrated from New York.
