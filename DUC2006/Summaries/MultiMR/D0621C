Charges against the reputed gangsters center around the killing of a mainland Chinese businessman and a Hong Kong resident, armed robberies, smuggling explosives into Hong Kong, and the kidnapping of the two Hong Kong businessmen for more than 1.6 billion Hong Kong dollars U.S. dlrs 205 million in ransom.
The South China Morning Post also quoted an unnamed prison source as saying Cheung and other defendants were fearful that some of Cheung's accomplices might try to poison them, so they were taking their meals from food that had been brought in for security officials.
