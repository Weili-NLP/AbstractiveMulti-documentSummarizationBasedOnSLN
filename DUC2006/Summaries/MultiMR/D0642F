But Chavez, a former army paratrooper who led a failed 1992 coup attempt in the name of the poor, shot back at his critics Sunday, describing them as part of a corrupt political elite that has ruined the oil-rich country.
 CARACAS, Venezuela AP Venezuelan, Mexican and Saudi oil ministerial delegations will meet in Madrid sometime next week to discuss the effectiveness of the three countries oil policy, Venezuelan President-elect Hugo Chavez said late Saturday.
 The torrential floods and mudslides sweeping away shantytowns in Caracas this week were inevitably compared to Wednesday's overwhelming vote for a new constitution that President Hugo Chavez sold to voters as a democratic tide to obliterate Venezuela's corrupt political system.
During his press conference Wednesday, Chavez reiterated his plans to root out corruption, review the country's oil policies and call a constituent assembly to rewrite the constitution.
I want to say to all Venezuelans that not only do I accept my adversary's victory, I also wish him much luck because his luck is Venezuela's luck, Salas said at his campaign headquarters in Caracas.
Chavez!
 In an effort to reassure foreign investors, Venezuela's president said Tuesday that his government would make all its debt payments while at the same time work on a market-friendly proposal that would allow it to pay off its current debt over a longer period of time.
He derided U.S. policies toward Cuba, including an economic embargo, as criminal, failed and ridiculous.
With 67 percent of Sunday's vote counted, Hugo Chavez's Patriotic Pole coalition won 34 percent of the congressional seats.
