Sir William Macpherson, a retired High Court justice who was the author of the report and chairman of the eight-month government inquiry, defined institutional racism as the collective failure of an organization to provide an appropriate professional service to people because of their color, culture or ethnic origin reflected, he said, in processes, attitudes and behavior which amounts to discrimination through unwitting prejudice, ignorance, thoughtlessness and racist stereotyping.
The inquiry into the Lawrence case and racism among the police ended in November after 69 days of hearings over an eight-month period and has taken on dramatic new life this year through a play based entirely on testimony called The Color of Justice that is playing to sellout audiences in a small West London theater and is moving to the West End in May.
 British Home Secretary Jack Straw Tuesday promised new measures to combat racism in the wake of the inquiry into the murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence.
The report was commissioned to investigate the police handling of the inquiry into the death of 18-year-old Stephen Lawrence who was fatally stabbed by white youths at a bus stop in south-east London in 1993.
Straw said he would lead a steering group including members from the Commission for Racial Equality, the Black Police Association, the Metropolitan Police and other police organizations and the Crown Prosecution Service to enact most of the recommendations.
 The chief of Britain's largest police force apologized Thursday to the parents of a black teenager whose stabbing death five years ago focused attention on relations between police and minorities.
