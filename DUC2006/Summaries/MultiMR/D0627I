At first, the Holts sent money to Korean orphanages, but soon decided that the children needed families.
At the time, federal law prevented any family from adopting more than two foreign-born children.
Harry Holt returned to Korea for more children, while Holt found families in the United States willing to take them.
In 1956, the Holts founded the agency that would become Holt International Children's Services.
At the time, there was no system in place for international adoptions.
Holt International now handles about 1,000 international adoptions each year from 12 countries.
Holt also worked to improve conditions at the Il San Center in Korea, built by the Holts as an orphanage and now home to 300 disabled children, and she lobbied other countries to set up adoption programs.
According to parliamentary estimates, there are about 80 foreign adoption agencies, mostly American, currently operating in Russia, usually through Russian intermediaries.
As recently as five or ten years ago, there were many more parents waiting to adopt than there were children, said Ms. Cox, whose agency has placed more than 100,000 children.
Among its major provisions, the treaty would : establish the first global standards intended to protect children from being sold and improve procedures for finding them homes ; prevent coercion of birth parents by unscrupulous practitioners who want their children ; and set guidelines to cut red tape and otherwise steamline the process for adoptive parents.
