 A 35-member mission headed by former United States President Jimmy Carter will arrive in Nicaragua next Thursday to observe the general elections to be held on October 20 in this country.
The Carter Center Council has observed 14 elections in nine countries of this hemisphere, including the 1990 Nicaraguan elections that marked the first peaceful transference of power from one party to another in this country.
Founded in 1982 by former U.S. president Jimmy Carter and his wife, the Carter Center has been devoted to observing many countries in respect of democracy and development, human rights issues and public health.
David Carroll, Carter Center's Associate Director of Democratic Program, was quoted as saying before his departure for Nigeria Monday that the upcoming presidential contest in Nigeria could be one of the most important elections that President Jimmy Carter has observed to date.
He noted that Carter regards the Nigerian election as the most important of the year because if the transition to civilian rule works in Nigeria, it could change the course of history in West Africa.
Carter said the election was the 18th his center will have observed in 10 Latin American nations.
 Jimmy Carter has monitored more than 20 elections in 16 countries since he left the White House, and not all of them were showcases of democracy.
 Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter will be in Mexico on July 2 to observe this country's highly competitive presidential election, an elections monitoring groups said Tuesday.
