Premier Lucien Bouchard, the separatists charismatic leader, is expected to hold the vote either late this year or next spring, and he plans to call another referendum on secession if he wins re-election.
The leader of the Quebec Liberals, Jean Charest, said the election would offer a clear choice to voters in the mostly French-speaking province.
In its historic ruling on the Quebec issue, the 9-member court said, the mainly French-speaking province can not separate from Canada under the Constitution of Canada and the international law.
On one level, Quebecers of many political stripes believe that it is entirely up to their provincial legislature to set the rules for a referendum that would decide the political future of Quebec, Canada's largest province.
Questioning the legality of Quebec's 30-year-fight for independence was a risky strategy for the federal government because any backlash against it in Quebec could make the separatist government of Premier Lucien Bouchard even more popular.
The separatist government in Quebec said they would hold another referendum if they are re-elected in a provincial election, which is expected next year.
Quebec premier Lucien Bouchard will have a problem if he promises another referendum in the next election because people in Quebec do n't want any referendum, Chretien said.
 Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien has ruled out the possibility that the French-speaking province of Quebec could declare independence even if a majority of Quebeckers vote for secession in the next referendum.
