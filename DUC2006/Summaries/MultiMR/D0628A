The study, led by Peter S. Jensen, a child and adolescent psychiatrist from the National Institute of Mental Health, found that fewer than one in eight children with ADHD were prescribed the stimulant medications.
About 5 percent of the children met all the criteria of ADHD, and 12 percent of those ADHD-diagnosed children had been treated with stimulant drugs in the past year.
The Alza pill is based on the drug methylphenidate, the generic version of Ritalin, which has been used since the 1950s to control ADHD.
The turning point in Alex's life came at age 5, with a clinical diagnosis of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and a prescription for Ritalin, which his mother describes as a miracle drug.
As more and more kids begin taking medications for psychiatric problems, the lack of safety data is becoming an urgent problem, especially in younger age groups, says Dr. Harold S. Koplewicz, vice chairman of the department of psychiatry at the New York University School of Medicine in New York City.
And, according to Koplewicz, most children are evaluated for mental illness not by child psychiatrists, but by pediatricians, many of whom have little training in mental health.
The researchers found that medication was substantially more effective than behavior-modification therapy in treating children with ADHD alone.
Between 3 and 6 percent of American school-age children suffer from a condition called attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD.
The subjects for the research were part of a previous study of families with an ADHD child and families with no ADHD children.
