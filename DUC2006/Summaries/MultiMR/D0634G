The Pacific Salmon Treaty, agreed to after five years of tough negotiations and years of disputes between U.S. and Canadian fishermen, revises a 1985 agreement to rebuild wild salmon runs and ensure that both sides get a fair share of the catch.
Some salmon runs are being listed as endangered or threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act.
The agreement has the effect of reducing Canada's catch of chinook salmon bound for streams in Washington, Oregon and Idaho, while giving Canada more of the Fraser River sockeye salmon that have been harvested by Washington and Oregon fishermen.
In March, acting under the Endangered Species Act, the federal government set in motion a regional plan to restore salmon runs throughout the Pacific Northwest.
 Buoyed by ad hoc accords that have boosted salmon spawning in both Puget Sound and British Columbia rivers, Washington Gov. Gary Locke and Canada's fisheries minister, David Anderson, say this is the year to resolve the U.S.-Canada fisheries dispute up and down the Pacific Coast.
It is a good deal because conservation means more fish for the future, said Canadian Fisheries Minister David Anderson.
The decline is most dramatic among chinook and coho salmon, species that are also imperiled in the Columbia River system and throughout the Pacific Northwest.
And that is not good for fish.
 Operators of three Columbia River dams have agreed with the Clinton administration on a 50-year preservation plan that may provide a model for how the Pacific Northwest goes about saving its endangered salmon.
