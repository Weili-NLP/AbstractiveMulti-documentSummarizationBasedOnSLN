Malaria affects 40 percent of the world's population in more than 90 countries while over 90 percent of the cases are in Africa where there are increasing levels of chloroquine resistance, the News Agency of Nigeria NAN Sunday quoted the recently-released WHO fact sheet as saying.
Malaria kills one million people every year in the world and the vast majority of deaths occur among young children and pregnant women in Africa, said the WHO's fact sheet.
It stated that the costs for the treatment of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa exceeded 2.1 billion U.S. Dollars last year alone.
In spite of drug resistance, malaria is a curable disease, it said, adding that research and development in malaria prevention and treatment have made advances.
About 550 million people in the African region risk the disease.
The malaria problem is increasing because the malaria parasite has developed resistance to some of the anti-malaria drugs and insecticides.
In four clinical trials in Africa, two out of 279 people who used Malarone for three months developed malaria.
Another eight clinical trials in countries in Africa, Asia, South America and Europe concluded Malarone is an effective malaria treatment, too.
The experts who met for the two-day preparatory committee meeting on the African initiative for malaria control in the 21st century were from different institutions affiliated to the World Health Organization WHO, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported Saturday.
There is no vaccine, and the disease causes the deaths of a million people annually in Africa alone.
