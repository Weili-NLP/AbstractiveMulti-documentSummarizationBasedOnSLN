 Oklahoma's catastrophic tornadoes were influenced by La Nina, the weather phenomenon 5,000 miles west of the prairie in the Pacific Ocean, scientists say.
La Nina refers to a large, unusually cold pool of water in the equatorial Pacific Ocean that develops every several years, and influences weather patterns around the world.
El Nino, which involves the equatorial waters in the Pacific warming up, creating unusual weather patterns around the world, increased winter temperatures in Lima by about 4 degrees centigrade about 7 degrees Fahrenheit.
A similar increase in temperatures brought on by El Nino in the summer was still connected to more diarrhea than usual, but the effect was not as strong, accounting for only a 50 percent rise in diarrhea cases, the researchers found.
If we can predict a change in the weather, such as when El Nino cycles around, we could have all the interventions in place before the weather changes.
Scientists cautioned that like its warm counterpart, El Nino, a La Nina condition will influence global climate and weather until it has completely subsided.
For the United States, an El Nino brings unusually warm temperatures to the northern states and cooler, wetter conditions to the South.
The scientists worked with a computer model currently used to predict El Nino events.
The 1997-98 El Nino, the strongest ever recorded, meant record rain in California, heavy flooding in Peru, drought in Indonesia and tornadoes and flooding in Florida.
