 NASA's aging Galileo spacecraft swooped past Jupiter's frozen moon Europa on Monday but apparently did not experience any computer problems from the planet's intense radiation.
The probe, which has been in orbit around Jupiter since December 1995, flew within 220 miles of the moon's surface, said project manager Jim Erickson of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
Some scientists believe life could survive in a liquid ocean beneath the frozen surface.
 An analysis of striking scalloped fracture lines in the frozen surface of Jupiter's moon Europa has yielded the strongest evidence yet that a global ocean of liquid water once lay beneath the thick crust of ice, and may still be there.
The research, based on detailed photographs from the Galileo spacecraft, shows how the extreme ebb and flow of tides in a subsurface ocean may have flexed the ice surface and created the elaborate patterns of curving cracks and ridges on Europa that are unlike anything else seen in the solar system.
The ocean, warmed by Europa's interior heat, could extend as deep as 100 miles, 20 times greater than Earth's oceans.
 NASA's aging Galileo spacecraft flew within 380 miles of Jupiter's moon Io, exposing the craft to so much radiation that mission controllers feared the probe might not survive.
 Volcanoes on a moon of Jupiter called Io may be the hottest place in the solar system outside the sun itself, researchers say.
