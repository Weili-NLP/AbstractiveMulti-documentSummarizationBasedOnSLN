 Investigators from the United States and Egypt will review part of the flight control system in the tail of Boeing's 767 airplane as part of the investigation into the crash of EgyptAir Flight 990, the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board said Friday.
The EgyptAir flight crashed into the Atlantic Ocean shortly after taking off from the New York International Airport on October 31, 1999, on its way to Cairo, killing 217 people on board.
The plane's flight data recorder, one of the two Black Boxes, was retrieved early Tuesday and now is under analysis by experts of U.S. National Transportation Safety Board NTSB in Washington.

 U.S. investigators on Wednesday are continuing the search for the cockpit voice recorder from the ocean depths where the Boeing 767-300 on EgyptAir Flight 990 crashed October 31.
Also, information from the flight data recorder released early in the investigation showed the plane's autopilot was switched off before it was put into a steep dive.
All 217 people on board died in the EgyptAir flight crash.
After an examination of the flight data recorder, the cockpit voice recorder, radar data and small amounts of wreckage, Hall said in November that there was no sign of mechanical failure that could have caused the crash.
