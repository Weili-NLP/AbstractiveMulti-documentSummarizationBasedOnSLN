La Nina and El Nino form the opposite ends of the same climatic cycle, with El Nino fueled by unusually warm water in the eastern Pacific and La Nina driven by cold.
El Nino is the name given to the unusual warming of waters in the Pacific Ocean that affects global wind and temperature patterns.
The change in the weather was, of course, the work of El Nino.
 Weather satellite data that detect warming in the Indian Ocean and the early signs of an El Nino in the Pacific may also give an early warning about an outbreak of Rift Valley Fever in Africa, according to a study by researchers.
It is blamed for flooding and heavy snow in the West, abnormally warm weather in the East and extreme weather from South America to Asia.
The scientists worked with a computer model currently used to predict El Nino events.
The current La Nina started when surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific dropped rapidly in May and June.
La Nina is linked to cooler conditions in central North America, and dry, warm conditions in the southern states.
El Nino is a periodic warming of the water in the eastern Pacific Ocean, which shifts weather patterns arriving from that area and can affect the climate worldwide.
According to Changnon, as few as 100 people died in winter cold and storms during the 1997-98 El Nino, well below the average of 850 in recent years.
