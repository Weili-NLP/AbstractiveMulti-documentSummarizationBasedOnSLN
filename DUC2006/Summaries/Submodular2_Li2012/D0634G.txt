Some salmon runs are being listed as endangered or threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act.
The decline is most dramatic among chinook and coho salmon, species that are also imperiled in the Columbia River system and throughout the Pacific Northwest.
And that is not good for fish.
The agreement has the effect of reducing Canada's catch of chinook salmon bound for streams in Washington, Oregon and Idaho, while giving Canada more of the Fraser River sockeye salmon that have been harvested by Washington and Oregon fishermen.
The Snake's coho salmon has already been declared extinct, and every other species of salmon and steelhead in the Snake River is now listed under the Endangered Species Act.
But there is no guarantee that the plan would work, and it would take out of service dams that provide about 4 percent of the Pacific Northwest's electricity.
That includes $ 91 million for U.S. Army Corps of Engineers projects in the Columbia-Snake river system ; $ 60 million to implement the Pacific Salmon Treaty between the United States and Canada ; and $ 39 million for the National Marine Fisheries Service's salmon recovery efforts.
It is a good deal because conservation means more fish for the future, said Canadian Fisheries Minister David Anderson.
 Headlines report a $ 400 million effort to save salmon on the Columbia and Snake rivers.
In Washington, Oregon, Idaho and California, 26 salmon populations are threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act.
