There are about 190 Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Peace Now, an Israeli group opposed to the government's settlement policy, visited all but two of Israel's 144 settlements in the West Bank and Gaza on Wednesday and counted 5,892 units under construction.
The other tenders were for several Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
They were angry with Barak for approving the construction of 2,600 new housing units this week in four settlements near Jerusalem, saying the settlement expansion could prevent the start of the final status talks and destroy the peace process.
Last week in Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told visiting Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon that the settlement activities violate agreements signed by Israel and the Palestinians, which ban any unilateral actions by both sides.
The Peace Now survey showed that at least 2,880 housing units in the Jewish settlements in the Palestinian territories of West Bank and Gaza Strip are vacant.
A statement issued by Netanyahu's office said the prime minister assured Muasher that Israel was still committed to the Middle East peace process.
Israel Radio reported earlier that all those 2,600 tenders were issued after the new government came to power in July and 1,000 of them were slated for Ma'aleh Adumim, the largest settlement east of Jerusalem with about 6,000 settlers.
 In defiance of fresh U.S. criticism over increasing Jewish settlement activities in the West Bank, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Monday pledged to further expand settlement construction.
