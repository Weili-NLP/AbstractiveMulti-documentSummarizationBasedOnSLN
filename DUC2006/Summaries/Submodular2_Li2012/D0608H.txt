Another safety agency, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, says more than 80 percent of child car seats are used improperly.
The system was designed to reduce the dangers of small children in child seats near air bags.
 The government should set up a nationwide network of fitting stations for child seats to help save children's lives in car crashes, the National Transportation Safety Board recommended Wednesday.
Another recent change came about because of injuries and deaths to children caused by air bags activating in the front seat.
 Cars should be designed with child safety first in mind, especially in the back seat where most children ride, the head of a federal safety agency says.
It's time to put children and their safety first in vehicle design, Hall said.
By next year, DaimlerChrysler will have the capacity to conduct 800,000 inspections annually to make sure children are buckled properly in child seats and child seats are properly installed in both new and older DaimlerChrysler vehicles, the company officials said.
More air bags, though, are on the way.
Connolly said this data would let auto manufacturers such as GM design better vehicles to protect passengers by understanding how drivers react to crashes.
Hall said the Safety Board is urging automakers to : Install shoulder belts in all rear seating positions in cars and light trucks, including the rear center seat where they are often missing.
