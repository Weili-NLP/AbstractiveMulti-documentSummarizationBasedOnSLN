Barnes & Noble's sales account for about 14 percent of the consumer book market.
In 1997, about 25 percent of adult book purchases were made at Barnes & Noble and other chains while just over 17 percent were made at independent stores.
Barnes & Noble has about 14 percent of the retail book market.
The request to the state agency was made by the Northern California Independent Booksellers Association and the American Booksellers Association.
As Richard Howorth, owner of Square Books in Oxford and president of the American Booksellers Association says, In 1991, when Barnes & Noble and Borders began to expand, there were 5,200 members of the ABA.
 Facing intensifying competition, the nation's trade association for independent booksellers is creating its own national online store, Book Sense, to stave off fierce competition from Amazon.com and Barnesandnoble.com.
For the first time that electronic commerce was measured as a category, online stores captured 2 percent of the book market while independent booksellers continued to lose share, which declined less than one percentage point, to 16.6 percent.
The unit sales of adult trade books are projected to grow more an indication that online sales are not expected to increase the market for popular books.
Any books we put on the Web site we make sure to make available in the store first, Gloss said.
In the book industry there are private books, local publishers, all kinds of books.
