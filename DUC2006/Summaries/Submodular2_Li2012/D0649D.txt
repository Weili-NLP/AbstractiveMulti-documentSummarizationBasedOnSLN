But what kind of man is Putin?
 Communist Party chief Gennady Zyuganov on Tuesday became the first candidate approved for Russia's March 26 presidential election, though polls show him still far behind acting President Vladimir Putin.
 Russian President Boris Yeltsin on Monday announced that he wanted acting Prime Minister Vladimir Putin to succeed him as Russia's next president in next summer elections.
 Russian acting President, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin will not leave Russia for a visit before the presidential election scheduled for March 26, said a top Kremlin official Tuesday.
The acting president has the support of about 60 percent of voters, with Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov in second place with 20 percent, opinion polls say.
With 96 percent of the vote counted, Russian election officials named Putin, 47, the winner of only the second democratic presidential election in Russia's history with 53 percent.
Since coming to power on Dec. 31 following Boris Yeltsin's resignation, the Soviet KGB veteran has repeatedly stressed his intention to enhance Russia's military might.
Putin, whose tough stance on the war in Chechnya has buoyed his popularity, said he will not repeat the mistakes of the last Chechen war, when Russian forces were defeated by rebels.
Prior to the 1996 presidential election, Putin led, on Sobchak's orders, the St. Petersburg NDR Our Home Is Russia office.
 Russian President-elect Vladimir Putin will be sworn in on May 7, Russia's Central Election Commission CEC chairman Alexander Veshnyakov said Sunday.
