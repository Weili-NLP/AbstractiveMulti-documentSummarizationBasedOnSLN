I had arthritis.
Monsanto said most osteoarthritis patients take Celebrex once a day.
Like Celebrex, Merck is looking to get approval for Vioxx to treat osteoarthritis, which affects more than 16 million Americans.
These drugs will treat the pain and inflammation associated with arthritis without the stomach problems associated with today's over-the-counter and prescription drugs, the companies say.
Vitamin E, another antioxidant, apparently has less effect on the progression of arthritis, but its anti-inflammatory effects may explain why some studies suggest vitamin E supplements may ease pain in some patients.
Vioxx and Celebrex are in a new class of drugs known as COX-2 inhibitors.
It will look at glucosamine, chondroitin and the two together to see whether they help control arthritis pain and whether they actually attack the underlying disease.
A different drug of the same type, Merck & Co.'s Vioxx, is awaiting approval by the Food and Drug Administration and could be on the market by summer.
The early results of research, including one study just published and another due out soon, suggest the treatment actually does ease joint pain and may even forestall further cartilage damage.
They offer the same pain relief as traditional arthritis drugs but cause fewer side effects, especially ulcers and intestinal bleeding.
Celebrex, approved for osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, has already sold more than 1.1 million prescriptions, making it the biggest new drug of 1999.
