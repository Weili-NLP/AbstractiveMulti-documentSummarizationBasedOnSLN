The administration's budget plan shows that Clinton would not use any of the Social Security surplus for other programs.
Clinton's plan includes $ 34 billion in tax cuts over five years, $ 39 billion in increased spending over the current fiscal year and projects a record $ 117 billion surplus.
Over the next five years, the measure would set aside at least $ 150 billion for tax cuts and the entire $ 1 trillion in projected Social Security surpluses for debt reduction, Republicans said.
 Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on Wednesday trashed President Clinton's plan to invest government funds in the stock market in order to produce more revenue for the Social Security retirement system.
The surplus is not the government's money.
Greenspan also used his appearance to reiterate his position that the federal budget surplus should be used to reduce the national debt rather than for tax cuts or new spending.
On taxes, Summers said Clinton would support a $ 250 billion cut.
Earlier this week the White House's Office of Management and Budget forecast similar budget surpluses.
Clinton would use more than half of the surplus to pay off what the nation owes to future Social Security retirees, reducing federal debt held by the public.
However, if political pressures on lawmakers to use surpluses are too great, the Fed chairman said, he would prefer a tax cut over new spending programs.
