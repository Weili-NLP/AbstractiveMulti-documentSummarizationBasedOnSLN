Could this be related to global warming?
Greenhouse gas emissions including carbon dioxide created by the burning of coal, gas and oil, are believed by most atmospheric scientists to cause the warming of the Earth's surface and a change in the global climate.
Greenhouse gas emissions blamed for global warming may cause the collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and raise the average global sea level by four to six metres, beginning as early as the next century, a new scientific study predicted recently.
They said that the changes are caused by a temperature increase, which is one of the effects of global warming.
A U.N. scientific panel has predicted that unless these greenhouse gas emissions are reduced, the earth's average surface temperature will rise by some 2 to 6 degrees Fahrenheit over the next century, with a best estimate of about 3.5 degrees, compared with a rise of 5 to 9 degrees since the depths of the last ice age 18,000 to 20,000 years ago.
In 1995, the U.N.-sponsored Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, where more than 2,000 scientists concluded in a landmark report that the balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate.
Those who believe that carbon dioxide and industrial gases are heating the atmosphere say the revisions now show a slight warming trend, in line with the warming of the Earth's surface.
Over the past 50 years, the Earth's average temperature has been increasing by around 0.79 C per century.
