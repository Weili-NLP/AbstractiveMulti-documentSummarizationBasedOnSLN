 New evidence from NASA's Galileo spacecraft bolsters theories that a liquid ocean lies beneath the crust of Jupiter's moon Europa, scientists reported Monday after analyzing results from the probe's latest flyby.
Galileo has transmitted stunning pictures of the more than 100 erupting volcanoes on Io, and clear evidence that Ganymede is the only moon in the solar system to have its own magnetic field, and data showing that an ocean may lurk below Callisto's surface ice and, even more likely, in the depths of Europa.
Jupiter's other major moons are Ganymede, Europa and Callisto.
Galileo took measurements of Europa's magnetic field during a Jan. 3 flyby 218 miles above the moon.
The probe, which has been in orbit around Jupiter since December 1995, flew within 220 miles of the moon's surface, said project manager Jim Erickson of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
I think these findings tell us that there is indeed a layer of liquid water beneath Europa's surface, said Margaret Kivelson, a spacecraft scientist.
As part of an extended mission, Galileo's instruments are studying the chemistry, heat distribution, gravity and magnetic properties of Io, Jupiter's innermost large moon and the only known actively volcanic solar system object besides Earth.
 Volcanoes on a moon of Jupiter called Io may be the hottest place in the solar system outside the sun itself, researchers say.
Some scientists believe life could survive in a liquid ocean beneath the frozen surface.
