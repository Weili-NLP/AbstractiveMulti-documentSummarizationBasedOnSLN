There was no news Thursday about the 118 men trapped since Saturday at the bottom of the Barents Sea aboard the Kursk, one of the newest and most powerful nuclear submarines in the Russian navy.
The Kursk was just five years old.
 Russian Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov said Thursday that collision with a big object caused the Kursk nuclear submarine to sink to the bottom of the Barents Sea.
Russian officials said the Kursk was not carrying nuclear weapons.
The crew has not been in radio contact with rescue ships since the submarine sank.
The Kursk was commissioned for the Russian Navy in 1995.
Government commission says Kursk collided with another object despite U.S. and Norwegian reports of massive explosion in region at time submarine went down.
 A Russian nuclear submarine that was stranded on the bottom of Barents Sea may have become partly filled with water, the Interfax news agency reported Monday.
The contracts are with the Norwegian company Stolt Offshore, whose divers were able to open the hatch of sunken submarine Kursk after Russian efforts failed for days.
The Foreign Ministry of Norway said Tuesday that it had received a report from Russia saying the accident occurred Saturday and that the Kursk was found on Sunday.
One explanation presumes that the submarine hit a World War II mine, the second is that the Kursk collided with another submarine, and the third is that an explosion took place inside the submarine's torpedo compartment.
