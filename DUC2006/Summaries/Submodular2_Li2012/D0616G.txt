Russia began its military operations in Chechnya in late September after Chechen rebels armed incursions into the neighboring republic of Dagestan and a spate of apartment building blasts that claimed over 300 people in Moscow and two other Russian cities.
As they suffer major losses following the federal offensive, Chechen rebels are planning more terrorist acts in Russia, Interfax quoted the Interior Ministry and the Federal Security Service as saying Sunday in a communique.
 Russian federal troops Tuesday continued air and artillery attacks on rebel positions in the breakaway republic of Chechnya, destroying some rebel bases and a communications relay station, the Defense Ministry said.
Chechen leaders claim some 3,600 people, mostly civilians, have been killed in Russian attacks.
 The latest report shows that the casualties of the Russian joint troops in Chechnya in a series of terrorist blasts made by Chechen rebels Sunday night have reached over 100, said the Russian Interior Ministry on Monday.
The Chechens have most of the territory in the more heavily populated regions south of the river, though the Russians have made inroads in western Chechnya and have been massing forces along Chechnya's eastern border.
As of July 20, the federal troops have lost 2,518 killed with 7, 956 wounded since the start of the anti-terrorist operation in the North Caucasus on August 2, 1999, the Interfax news agency reported.
Russia has put an estimated 13,000 troops along the breakaway republic's border with Dagestan.
