Air France grounded its remaining five Concordes immediately after the July 25 crash near Paris that killed 113 people.
British Airways resumed its Concorde flights after a single day's pause after the Air France flight crashed outside Paris on July 25, killing 113 people.
French investigators have said they believe that a thin strip of metal fell off the Continental plane, which had taken off on the same runway as the Concorde, and set off the events that caused the Air France jet to burst into flames and crash within minutes after its takeoff.
 French investigators looking into the crash last month of an Air France Concorde said Thursday it was probable that a 16-inch piece of metal found on the runway caused a tire to blow out, sending debris from the tire through fuel tanks and triggering a fire that brought down the plane.
Air France Concorde flights were immediately suspended.
 Investigators removed two engines from the Concorde crash site Wednesday in hopes the wreckage of the Air France supersonic jet will help determine the cause of the disaster that killed 113 people.
British Airways, the only other airline to fly the high-speed transport planes, resumed its Concorde flights between New York and London Wednesday.
 The doomed Air France Concorde apparently lost power in two of its four engines as it was taking off, and the flight crew was unable to retract the aircraft's landing gear, government investigators said Thursday.
