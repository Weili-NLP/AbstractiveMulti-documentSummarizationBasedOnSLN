The Galileo planet Jupiter space probe launched aboard Space Shuttle Atlantis at October 18, 1989. It released from Galileo at July 13, 1996. It entered Jupiter atmosphere at December 7, 1997. Galileo, positioned its antenna to Earth. Europa, had enough heat. Callisto, had no dense core. A probe founded twice the concentration of volatile elements like argon like nitrogen. Jupiter, imageded faint rings. Ganymede, indicated a fluid metal core. Michael Belton, released the findings during a media teleconference. the spacecraft Now founded the convincing signs in the form of salt deposits on the moon 's icy surface for a Europan sea. the closest-ever flyby of Jupiter 's innermost large moon took place at at 10:06 p.m. PDT at Sunday. A team of astronomers founded the telling evidence from visible infrared light, of the south equatorial belt in images. Jupiter formed 10 times from the sun. high temperatures with constantly stormy weather had wide variations in radiation levels. a team of scientists reported The results in Thursday issue of Nature. Io, had overlain by rock and over 100 active volcanoes. images of icebergs on the icy crust indicated the the possible precursors of life _ in a warm ocean miles as_for Europa beneath the ice. the spacecraft endured such a strong dose of radiation from Jupiter. glitch-prone Galileo spacecraft overcominged huge doses of radiation before the approach. The data return included an average of two before day before December 1997 to three images per day before December 1997. The probe made the closest-ever flyby at 10:06 p.m. PDT at Sunday.
