Despite the almost visceral hostility from independent booksellers, said Albert Greco, an associate business professor at Fordham University who follows publishing, Barnes & Noble's move was born out of its need to remain competitive in the face of potentially damaging market inroads made by online book operators, which will transform the selling of books.
 Facing intensifying competition, the nation's trade association for independent booksellers is creating its own national online store, Book Sense, to stave off fierce competition from Amazon.com and Barnesandnoble.com.
A consumer purchasing report released by the Book Industry Study Group shows that independent booksellers experienced a 1.4 percent market-share decline last year, down to 17 percent of the books purchased.
Independent booksellers have been assaulted first by chain superstores, then Internet purveyors led by Seattle's Amazon.com, so the indies have seen their portion of the book market cut in half to 16.6 percent during this decade and membership in their trade organization drop from 5,200 to 3,500.
Ms. Fox said that unless Barnes & Noble set up some system of fire walls, as the new owner of Ingram it would have access to extensive information about Amazon.com's actual unit sales of books online.
So as the country's independent booksellers and publishers now called BookExpo there was reason for hope about upcoming books and the selling seasons ahead.
