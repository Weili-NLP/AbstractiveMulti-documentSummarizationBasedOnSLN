We also sought a mandate to get conditions for a winning referendum on Quebec sovereignty, Bouchard said of the referendum issue.
Barring a surprise in the campaign's final week, separatist Premier Lucien Bouchard and his Parti Quebecois are expected to win another term in provincial elections Nov. 30 and begin laying the groundwork for Quebec's third referendum on leaving Canada.
In the 33-day campaign, PQ leader Bouchard maintained that if re-elected, his government would seek another referendum on Quebec independence from Canada when winning conditions exist.
 Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien has ruled out the possibility that the French-speaking province of Quebec could declare independence even if a majority of Quebeckers vote for secession in the next referendum.
Quebec is the only Canadian province with a French majority, 80 percent of 7.3 million people, and surveys have shown that about two-thirds of French speakers support either outright secession or some degree of sovereignty from the rest of Canada.
Quebec and Canada face a crucial test tomorrow as Quebecers go to the polls in the first provincewide elections since the separatists narrowly lost a referendum on independence in 1995.
 Lucien Bouchard is expected to become Parti Quebecois leader and Quebec premier at the end of this month, reviving a crusade for Quebec independence from Canada.
Bouchard's moving into the Quebec politics will keep the independence movement in the province alive.
