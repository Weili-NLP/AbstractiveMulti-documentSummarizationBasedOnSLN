 Chechen rebels have been shooting at Russian federal military and police posts in Chechnya and at local polling stations set up for Sunday's presidential elections, the Interfax news agency reported Saturday.
Russia began its military operations in Chechnya in late September after Chechen rebels armed incursions into the neighboring republic of Dagestan and a spate of apartment building blasts that claimed over 300 people in Moscow and two other Russian cities.
The Defense Ministry believes that Chechen rebels intend to let federal troops into Chechnya and then launch large-scale retribution actions while staging subversive and terrorist acts in the three Russian border regions of Daghestan, Stavropol and Krasnodar.
 Russian federal troops continued aerial and artillery attacks on rebel positions Friday in the breakaway republic of Chechnya as Moscow declared victory in the first stage of offensives against Islamic militants there.
 The latest report shows that the casualties of the Russian joint troops in Chechnya in a series of terrorist blasts made by Chechen rebels Sunday night have reached over 100, said the Russian Interior Ministry on Monday.
 President Boris Yeltsin today announced that Russian forces would halt their offensive in rebel Chechnya from midnight 2000 GMT today and start a partial withdrawal from some areas, but warned that Chechen separatist fighters would be hit hard if they stage terrorist attacks.
