West Nile virus is this summer's scary disease.
 The number of birds and mosquitoes testing positive for West Nile virus in New York state is accelerating rapidly, state health officials reported on Wednesday, a finding that is inspiring yet more pesticide spraying in New York City, on Long Island and in other areas.
Spinal fluid samples from 77 people who fell ill but tested negative for St. Louis encephalitis would be re-examined for the West Nile or Kunjin virus, city Health Commissioner Dr. Neal Cohen told The New York Times.
The publicity about the West Nile virus and counties intensified mosquito control efforts have prompted more residents to call about dead crows they have found, which has led to more testing, said Dennis McGowan, a spokesman for the state Department of Health and Senior Services.
A. Infected mosquitoes are the primary source for West Nile virus.
Health officials have been concerned that infected birds might spread the West Nile virus if they migrated from New York.
The August outbreak in New York City marked the first time that West Nile, which lives in birds but can pass to horses and humans via mosquitoes, had ever been seen in this hemisphere ; by the time cold weather ended the mosquito season, the virus had spread from Connecticut to Maryland.
