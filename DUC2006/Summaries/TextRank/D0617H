 Investigators from the United States and Egypt will review part of the flight control system in the tail of Boeing's 767 airplane as part of the investigation into the crash of EgyptAir Flight 990, the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board said Friday.
 Egyptian pilots have demanded the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board NTSB hand over the probe into the 1999 EgyptAir plane crash to a third party if it fails to release key evidence, Egypt's Al-Ahram daily reported on Tuesday.
 Investigators, aided by several Arabic interpreters, pored over the cockpit voice recorder of EgyptAir Flight 990 Monday to try to determine whether a criminal act caused the plane to crash two weeks ago killing all 217 people on board.
 National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Jim Hall said Friday that additional studies must be completed before his agency can determine the cause of the EgyptAir 990 crash, and he disputed an Associated Press report that investigators are increasingly convinced the jet was crashed deliberately.
 Cruising at 33,000 feet, EgyptAir Flight 990 was uneventful until the plane's autopilot disconnected about 8 seconds before the jetliner, with 217 people aboard, began to drop down toward the Atlantic Ocean, crash investigators said Wednesday.
The plane's flight data recorder, one of the two Black Boxes, was retrieved early Tuesday and now is under analysis by experts of U.S. National Transportation Safety Board NTSB in Washington.
