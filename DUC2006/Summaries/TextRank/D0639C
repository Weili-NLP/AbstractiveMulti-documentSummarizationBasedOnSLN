Soil sample from the plant site showed traces of EMPTA, a manmade chemical that has no commercial uses and is a key ingredient in the deadly nerve agent VX, U.S. intelligence officials said.
Defense Secretary William Cohen said in a press conference Thursday that the administration had bombed the Shifa Chemical Complex in Northeast Khartoum in the Sudan because the intelligence community was confident that the plant was involved in the production of chemical weapons agents, including precursor chemicals for deadly V-series of nerve agents, like, for example, VX.
The statement by the law firm said the U.S. government has retreated systematically from declarations that high officials made two years ago to justify the attack on the plant, except for the claim that a chemical component of VX nerve gas known as Empta was found in a soil sample taken by a foreign agent near the plant.
 Facing questions about the U.S. missile attack on a pharmaceutical plant in Sudan, the Clinton administration on Sunday sought to justify the strike by offering more details linking the factory to the production of chemical weapons.
Administration officials said Monday that the pharmaceutical factory, Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries, had been targeted after soil samples from outside the plant, secretly obtained months ago, were found to have a rare chemical needed for the manufacture of VX.
