Some property owners are dropping out of federal affordable housing subsidy programs in which low-income people pay about 30 percent of their income as rent.
The report, issued by Andrew Cuomo, the U.S. secretary of housing and urban development, said that 5.4 million low-income families pay more than half their incomes for housing or live in dilapidated units, an increase of 12 percent since the economic expansion began in 1991.
The bill is also expected to include a provision sought by New York City that would let housing authorities set aside more units for higher income families provided they exceeded federal requirements for giving housing vouchers to the very poor.
&QL; Current federal rules strictly limit the number of vacant apartments a housing authority can rent to the working poor, defined as families earning more than 50 percent of a region's median annual income.
 President Clinton will propose 120,000 new housing vouchers for working-class families in the federal budget that he will send to Congress in February, administration officials said Tuesday.
About the only housing program that seems to win new money from Congress is the development of prisons, said Dunlap, noting that Congress has not approved new housing assistance vouchers for low-income families since 1995 when Republicans took over Congress and cut additional housing assistance vouchers from the federal budget.
