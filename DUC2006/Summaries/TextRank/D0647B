 As the city's streets settled into an uneasy calm, the battle over six-year-old Cuban rafter Elian Gonzalez moved to court Friday with the boy's Miami relatives hoping to overturn a decision by federal immigration officials to send him back to his father in Cuba.
Telling the crowd of hard and difficult days suffered since the child was rescued at sea, Gonzalez said that our tears have given way to patriotic pride seeing tens of thousands turn out regularly demand Elian's return.
 The Clinton administration moved forcefully Monday to end the drama over Elian Gonzalez as officials took steps to take custody of the 6-year-old boy from his relatives in Miami as early as Thursday and return him to his father in Cuba.
About 11 p.m., officials from the powerful Cuban American National Foundation announced that the Miami relatives would travel to Washington Wednesday with Elian for a meeting with the boy's father.
Justice Department officials laid the groundwork for taking control of Elian by asserting that the boy's Miami relatives had failed to comply with a government request to say explicitly that they would not block his return to his father Cuba if they lost their court fight.
The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta rules for the government and Elian's father, but orders the boy to remain in the United States pending appeal.
