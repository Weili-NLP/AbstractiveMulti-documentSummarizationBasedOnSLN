Since his election, Chavez has said he would cut Venezuela's bloated government payroll, reduce the fiscal deficit and honor the country's dlrs 21 billion foreign debt.
 The torrential floods and mudslides sweeping away shantytowns in Caracas this week were inevitably compared to Wednesday's overwhelming vote for a new constitution that President Hugo Chavez sold to voters as a democratic tide to obliterate Venezuela's corrupt political system.
 Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez expressed his concern Saturday over a lawsuit filed by a group of small U.S. oil producers about alleged unfair practices in Venezuelan and Mexican oil prices.
The Constitution, and with it the ill-fated political system to which it gave birth 40 years ago, has to die, Chavez said in his address.
The foreign policy of Venezuela's new president Hugo Chavez, who was sworn in Tuesday, would be based on peace, integration and the defense of human rights, Rangel said.
At a time when the rest of Latin America has been moving largely toward streamlining the role of government and selling off state assets, Chavez speaks of subordinating the state oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela, to domestic priorities, and asks whether $ 9 billion earmarked for operations and investment by the oil company should not go to shore up decaying schools and hospitals instead.
