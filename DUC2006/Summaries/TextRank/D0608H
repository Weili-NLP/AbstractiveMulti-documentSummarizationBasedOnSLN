 The government should set up a nationwide network of fitting stations for child seats to help save children's lives in car crashes, the National Transportation Safety Board recommended Wednesday.
Since children under 12 are supposed to be traveling in rear seats at all times, the advisory urged car manufacturers to deactivate rear side air bags before shipping vehicles to dealers.
Under the new standards, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration will require air bags to protect vehicle occupants in a 25 mph crash test, the level supported by automakers, rather than a test at 30 mph favored by some consumer advocates.
Hall said crash tests that automakers must pass for federal safety compliance should include child dummies in the back seats to learn how well the vehicles protect them from head and neck injuries.
This car is, without a doubt, the safest Volvo ever built, thanks to innovations including computerized stability and traction control, advanced antilock braking, new seats that offer much-improved whiplash protection in rear-end crashes, and the inflatable curtain, Volvo's version of the side airbag system to protect the driver and front passenger in the event of a T-bone collision.
About 7,500 people in the United States each year die from side-impact crashes and a growing number of auto manufacturers are installing side air bags as standard or optional equipment to provide greater safety.
