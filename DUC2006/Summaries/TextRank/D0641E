Greenhouse gas emissions including carbon dioxide created by the burning of coal, gas and oil, are believed by most atmospheric scientists to cause the warming of the Earth's surface and a change in the global climate.
While countries work out the details of the Kyoto agreement, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change stated that the lack of scientific understanding of the effects of global warming on the West Antarctic Ice Sheet limits the ability to predict the risk of the collapse or melting.
 Scientists looking for signs of global warming should spend more time scrutinizing Earth's weather circulation patterns, a new study suggests.
Global warming is the change in the climate thought to occur because human activities add to a buildup of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide.
 There is neither evidence that global warming is a serious problem and nor truly cause to worry that emissions of waste industrial gases that trap heat like carbon dioxide could disrupt the world's climate, said an American scientist.
 New study suggests that El Nino may help slow the global warming, though it has been blamed for many climate disorders such as floods and droughts, according to a report published in the Washington Post.
He said global warming and climate change was not simply a matter which could be left to researchers and experts.
