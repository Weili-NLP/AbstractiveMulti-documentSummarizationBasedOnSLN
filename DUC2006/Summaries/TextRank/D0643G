Although La Nina is already affecting rainfall in Southeast Asia, it has n't noticeably influenced North America's weather yet, Leetmaa said Instead, it may be that warm water left over from El Nino is contributing to the formation of more tropical storms than normal in the eastern Pacific.
 Despite causing anomaly of weather and climate, the El Nino event may help cut global warming by temporarily stemming the release of carbon dioxide from the Pacific Ocean, scientists suggested Thursday.
The 1997-98 El Nino, the strongest ever recorded, meant record rain in California, heavy flooding in Peru, drought in Indonesia and tornadoes and flooding in Florida.
 Weather satellite data that detect warming in the Indian Ocean and the early signs of an El Nino in the Pacific may also give an early warning about an outbreak of Rift Valley Fever in Africa, according to a study by researchers.
However, forecasters have warned that the El Nino weather phenomenon will continue raging through late spring.
IN December, scientists from the Woods Hole Research Laboratory in Massachusetts reported in the journal Nature that during El Nino years that bring hot, dry weather to the Amazon, Brazil's rain forest sends out more carbon dioxide gas, trapping heat in the atmosphere.
The extreme weather is just the opposite of the extremes those areas suffered during the 1997-98 El Nino.
