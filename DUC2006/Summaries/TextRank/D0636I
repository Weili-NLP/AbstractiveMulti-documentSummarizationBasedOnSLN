GM's new strategy, and particularly Wednesday's plan for new assembly plants, represents a challenge to the United Automobile Workers union, which last week settled a strike of nearly two months at two auto parts factories in Flint, Mich..
In a speech kicking off the union's triennial bargaining convention, Yokich said job security would again be the UAW's priority when it begins contract talks in June with GM, Ford Motor Co. and the Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler AG.
The UAW also wanted Delphi workers covered under the GM national contract for the foreseeable future.
The UAW has not held a national strike in years, but has held several local strikes at GM, including a 54-day strike at two Flint plants last summer that shut down most of the company's North American production.
And UAW President Stephen P. Yokich told union members in a taped message earlier in the week that Ford was being stubborn about accepting contracts agreed to by GM and DaimlerChrysler.
In Mexico, where the strike has idled 23,000 workers at two dozen Delphi plants, Delphi managers have told workers that the union is demanding that GM close its Mexican plants and return its parts production to the United States, said Juan Villafuerte Morales, a union officer representing workers at Delphi's Matamoros factories.
