Carl Schmid, an alternative GOP delegate to the GOP convention from Washington, D.C., who serves on the board of the Human Rights Campaign, the largest gay rights advocacy organization in the nation, said he was meeting with Bush in an effort to improve the understanding of gay people and gay issues within the Republican party.
 Texas Gov. George W. Bush's top campaign strategist defended the Republican presidential frontrunner's controversial decision to snub leaders of a gay GOP group, asserting Wednesday that the Log Cabin Republicans have been critical of Bush on several issues.
 Anti-gay rights groups concerned about Gov. George W. Bush's recent meeting with gay Republicans now want the probable GOP presidential nominee to meet with them so they can enlighten him about the homosexual political agenda.
 Homosexual Republicans rejoiced, but religious conservative delegates sat in silent protest Tuesday as their party's only openly gay congressman addressed the Republican National Convention.
Still, Tafel said gay Republicans are trying to look past the Republican platform debate to the convention itself and Bush's campaign against Vice President Al Gore.
After months of declining to meet with leaders of the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay organization, Bush earlier this month huddled privately with 12 gay Republicans hand-picked by his campaign.
Gay Republicans hope Farris is wrong and that Bush is simply doing what he must to win the GOP primaries.
