While countries work out the details of the Kyoto agreement, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change stated that the lack of scientific understanding of the effects of global warming on the West Antarctic Ice Sheet limits the ability to predict the risk of the collapse or melting.
He quoted the Second Assessment Report compiled by the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change as saying that as long as emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere are allowed to continue in a business as usual manner, global warming will occur and occasion changes in the climate system.
 Long-term climate change such as global warming could have major impacts on human health, the environment, the economy and society, said Dr. James Baker, Director of U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
Greenhouse gas emissions including carbon dioxide created by the burning of coal, gas and oil, are believed by most atmospheric scientists to cause the warming of the Earth's surface and a change in the global climate.
Welch said that if the warming continues as part of a broader global climate change, the salmon as a species may be forced northward into the Bering Sea, abandoning their traditional Pacific habitat.
Global warming is the change in the climate thought to occur because human activities add to a buildup of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide.
