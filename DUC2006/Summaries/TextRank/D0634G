 Lending political momentum to an idea that would have been unthinkable in a different era of Pacific Northwest history, Gov. John A. Kitzhaber of Oregon announced Friday that he favored breaching four large federal dams on Washington state's Snake River in an effort to restore endangered salmon populations.
While the fisheries service is expected to recommend waiting for several years before a decision is made, the Environmental Protection Agency told the corps recently that the four dams harmed the river's water quality, endangered the salmon and might have to be breached to comply with the federal Clean Water Act.
The PATH report assumed that salmon that are barged through the lower Snake River dams are considerably less likely to survive a round-trip to the Pacific Ocean than non-barged fish.
Conservation efforts have focused not so much on entire species of Pacific salmon as on specific stocks, a group of fish that spawn in the same locality, like a specific creek.
 Buoyed by ad hoc accords that have boosted salmon spawning in both Puget Sound and British Columbia rivers, Washington Gov. Gary Locke and Canada's fisheries minister, David Anderson, say this is the year to resolve the U.S.-Canada fisheries dispute up and down the Pacific Coast.
Hatcheries have been part of the Pacific salmon equation since 1872, when the U.S. Fish Commission built the first one on the McCloud River in Northern California.
