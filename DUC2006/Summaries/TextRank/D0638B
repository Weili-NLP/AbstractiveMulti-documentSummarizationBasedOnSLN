 New evidence from NASA's Galileo spacecraft bolsters theories that a liquid ocean lies beneath the crust of Jupiter's moon Europa, scientists reported Monday after analyzing results from the probe's latest flyby.
Galileo has transmitted stunning pictures of the more than 100 erupting volcanoes on Io, and clear evidence that Ganymede is the only moon in the solar system to have its own magnetic field, and data showing that an ocean may lurk below Callisto's surface ice and, even more likely, in the depths of Europa.
 &UR; Distributed by New York Times Special Features &LR; &QC; For about two years the space probe Galileo has been gathering ever more evidence that a large ocean lies hidden beneath the frozen, fractured surface of Jupiter's moon Europa.
 NASA's aging Galileo spacecraft flew within 380 miles of Jupiter's moon Io, exposing the craft to so much radiation that mission controllers feared the probe might not survive.
As part of an extended mission, Galileo's instruments are studying the chemistry, heat distribution, gravity and magnetic properties of Io, Jupiter's innermost large moon and the only known actively volcanic solar system object besides Earth.
But the electric currents that Galileo's magnetometer first detected on Europa's surface indicate that Jupiter's erratic magnetic field is strongly influencing the currents around the satellite, Kivelson said.
