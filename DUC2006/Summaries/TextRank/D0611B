In his commentary on the experiments published by Nature, Martin Wolfe, a plant pathologist and research director of the Elm Farm Research Center, an organic farming research center in Britain, supports the approach.
Decaying plant wastes, such as grass clippings, leaves and vegetable scraps from the kitchen are great building blocks for compost, the ideal organic matter for your garden soil.
When you garden organically, you think of your plants as part of a whole system within nature that starts in the soil and includes the water supply, wildlife and even insects.
Jones advocacy of organic methods is both philosophical and flowers, alfalfa planted alongside cash crops attract beneficial insects and simultaneously take care of such nasty critters as the lygus bug, a small insect that winters in the hills and comes down to the valley in spring.
Topolos, who before adopting biodynamic farming principles three years ago had farmed his vineyards organically for the 10 years, said biodynamics heals the negative effects of farm chemicals by helping the soil to regenerate its original energy so the vines can fend off insects and diseases.
By definition, organic farming eschews artificial fertilizers and pesticides, instead harnessing the power of natural substances, such as compost, bacteria and pest-targeted insects and protective netting, to build healthy soil and keep invading forces at bay.
