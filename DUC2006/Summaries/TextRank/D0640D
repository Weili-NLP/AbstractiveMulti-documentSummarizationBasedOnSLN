 Chief of staff of the Russian Northern Fleet Mikhail Motsak on Monday officially confirmed the death of the 118 crew aboard the Kursk nuclear submarine that went down to the bottom of the Barents Sea on August 12.
 Six days after something went dreadfully wrong with the Russian nuclear submarine Kursk, another submarine quietly pulled into a Norwegian port, carrying some of the most detailed evidence so far of why the pride of Russia's Navy sank to the bottom of the Barents Sea.
 British and Norwegian rescuers joined their Russian counterparts late Saturday in efforts to rescue the Kursk nuclear submarine that has been stranded at the bottom of the Barents Sea for a week.
 Russian Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov said Thursday that collision with a big object caused the Kursk nuclear submarine to sink to the bottom of the Barents Sea.
 Russia has turned down a French proposal to help it evacuate the crew of the sunken submarine Kursk in the Barents Sea, Agence France-Presse AFP quoted French navy officials as saying Tuesday.
 Norwegian divers opened the inner hatch of the sunken Russian nuclear-powered submarine Kursk's ninth unit at about 1 p.m. Moscow time 0900 GMT Monday, Russian media reported.
 A Russian general claimed Monday that rescuers located an object near the wrecked nuclear submarine Kursk that resembled equipment from a U.S. or British ship, but a navy spokesman denied any such discovery.
