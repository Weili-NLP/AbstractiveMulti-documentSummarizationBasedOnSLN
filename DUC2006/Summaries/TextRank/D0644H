 The centerpiece of the Clinton administration's economic policy this year has been a demand that the Republican-controlled Congress forgo tax cuts and set aside the projected federal budget surplus until the nation shores up the Social Security system.
 Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on Wednesday trashed President Clinton's plan to invest government funds in the stock market in order to produce more revenue for the Social Security retirement system.
House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, slammed Clinton's budget for using $ 1 trillion in projected surplus money for new programs rather than tax cuts.
Greenspan also used his appearance to reiterate his position that the federal budget surplus should be used to reduce the national debt rather than for tax cuts or new spending.
Greenspan told the Senate Budget Committee yesterday that President Clinton's plan to save Social Security is a major step in the right direction, but tax hikes or benefit cuts are inevitable to make it solvent.
White House budget director Jack Lew said Clinton's budget blueprint would cut projected debt costs to just 2 cents out of every federal tax dollar in 2014.
While the Social Security issue is expected to receive more attention in Congress this year, Republicans are also eying the budget surplus for tax cuts.
Greenspan also resurrected concerns he expressed last week about Clinton's proposal to invest a portion of the federal budget surplus in the stock market.
