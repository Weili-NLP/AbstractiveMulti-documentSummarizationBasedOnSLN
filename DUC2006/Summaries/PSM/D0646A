The first two impeachment articles that the House will debate Thursday charge President Clinton with perjury in the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal
Kenneth Starr may have convinced most of America that President Clinton lied under oath
the Senate convicted him of lying when he testified in his own defense at his trial found him guilty of eight articles of impeachment could not come up with the necessary 67 votes to convict Clinton and oust him from office
The case revolves around two impeachment articles approved Dec. 19 by the House , finding that Clinton committed perjury before the grand jury and obstructed justice show that , even in civil cases , judges are sometimes provoked by perjury more than by many of the evils they see every day
Clinton made other false statements during his testimony denied touching private parts of Lewinsky 's body , which Lewinsky testified did occur gave a very different explanation under oath for a deposition in the Jones case does not face possible jail time because the contempt citation was issued in a civil , not criminal , case 's denial in his Jan. 17 deposition in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit that he ever had a `` sexual affair , '' a `` sexual relationship '' or `` sexual relations '' with Lewinsky
Republicans who believe that Clinton committed perjury noted that Clinton did engage in sexual activities with Lewinsky that were included in the definition
courts ruling that some obviously misleading statements like those Clinton acknowledges making may not constitute perjury under the law
