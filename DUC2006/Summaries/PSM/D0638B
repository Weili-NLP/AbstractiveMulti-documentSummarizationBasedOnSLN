NASA's aging Galileo spacecraft swooped past Jupiter 's frozen moon Europa on Monday
Io is the most volcanically active body in the solar system is 2,236 miles ( 3,598 kilometers ) in diameter , slightly larger than the Earth 's moon intersects powerful magnetic field lines from the giant planet and acts like an enormous electrical generator causes Io to glow when it is in the shadow of Jupiter has fields of red and green is one of four Jupiter moons discovered by Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei , one of the first astronomers to study the heavens with a telescope has been found by the Galileo spacecraft to have a giant iron core that takes up half its diameter
Jupiter's moon Europa could not support life because oceans beneath the frozen surface could barely support single-cell organisms , let alone complex species such as those found on Earth , researchers said Thursday
MADISON , Wisconsin ( AP ) _ More than 30 volcanoes spew lava
Tidal forces from Jupiter creating frictional heat that erupts in at least 32 volcanoes
Galileo took the data during its flyby within 559 miles of the Jupiter 's moon last December 7 , as the probe passed by Io on its way to enter orbit around the Jupiter measured Europa 's magnetic fields in an effort to detect disturbances from a suspected liquid ocean beneath the moon 's icy crust
The data was collected in December 1995 when a probe set loose from the Galileo spacecraft , in orbit around Jupiter , plunged into the planet 's atmosphere
