the occasional warming and cooling cycles in the tropical Pacific Ocean known as El Nino and La Nina are unwelcome visitors _ barging in , usually with little warning , then staying for months or sometimes a year or two , bringing all kinds of baggage in the form of distorted patterns of storms and droughts , heat and cold
El Nino , a disruptive weather phenomenon that returned in 1997 , has been blamed for flooding in Kenya , drought in Indonesia and heavy snow in the southwestern United States
strong warm episode ( El Nino ) conditions have persisted in the tropical Pacific since July 1997
Oceanographers over the last 20 years have developed an understanding of how El Nino and La Nina form _ with changes in winds and atmospheric pressure allowing warm surface water to flow east in an El Nino or spreading cool water west in a La Nina
Wang and his colleagues say that sunspot activity can affect ocean temperatures and cloud , which give rise to El Nino found the links between sunspot activity and El Nino through satellite photos
The research team found that El Nino was weak to non-existent around the lake between 5,000 and 12,000 years ago , but as an accompanying article in Science notes , other new records from western Pacific corals and sediment from the Great Lakes show El Nino was in action 12,000 to 120,000 years ago
The world was also warmer in that quiet El Nino period , further pointing to a possible relationship between El Nino and global warming
