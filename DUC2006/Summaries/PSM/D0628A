SAN DIEGO ( AP ) _ About a million miles ( kilometers ) away
Dr. Steven Pliszka , chief of child and adolescent psychiatry at the University of Texas Health Science Center , was the lead investigator in the study published this month in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry
authors of the study -- which involved 212 boys , including 75 with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder , or ADHD -- said the findings should help allay concerns that giving children potentially addictive drugs such as Ritalin may promote harmful habits later
recent research shows dramatic increases in the use of drugs like Ritalin to treat children with ADHD , suggesting the disorder is either becoming more common
ADHD is an educated guess makes it difficult for children to concentrate in class and in many instances makes them hyperactive and unruly has been estimated to affect 3 percent to 5 percent of school-age children nationwide , with less than 3 percent actually receiving medication affects 3 percent to 9 percent of all children , limiting their ability to focus , and accounts for one-third to one-half of referrals for mental health services for kids
the problem is that thousands of children are n't treated and more than one-half of children with the disorder have not been diagnosed is that other conditions , such as anxiety or depression , can mimic the symptoms of ADHD
Breggin , author of several books on the subject , crusades against psychotropic drugs as a whole , and calls Attention Deficit Disorder and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder '' a fabrication
