Oppenheimer pointed to studies made of two ice shelves to the north of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet that had been disintegrating for several decades , possibly because of local atmospheric warming Using the climate change predictions of the Intergovernmental Panel and the continued growth in greenhouse gas emissions Conflicting scientific views on the effect global warming would have on ice caps had confused the issue
Fahrenheit ( 0.05 degrees Celsius ) per decade , while the middle to upper troposphere _ a region centered about four miles ( 6.4 kilometers ) up _ seemed to be warming .05 degrees Fahrenheit ( 0.03 degrees Celsius ) every decade seemed to be cooling .09 degrees
A study of changes in wind patterns linked to global warming over the past 50 years are slowing the planet 's daily spin by around half a millisecond every century
Greenhouse gas emissions - blamed for global warming - may cause the collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and raise the average global sea level by four to six metres , beginning as early as the next century
Scientists have become more and more concerned about the possible health consequences of global warming were confounded because temperatures in the lower troposphere , the region from the ground to about two miles ( 3.2 kilometers ) up
the Earth's average temperature has been increasing by around 0.79 C per century
Kelly said that while the Global Climate Coalition questions whether global warming is happening , it advocates that companies voluntarily explore and employ new technology to reduce emissions that contribute to global warming
