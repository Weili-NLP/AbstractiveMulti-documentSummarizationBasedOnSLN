Home-made computer viruses are not new in Bangladesh , as the country 's first locally-produced virus , the Dhaka Virus , was created in 1991
The first virus known to hit personal computers was called the Brain
Software companies posted new virus-killing programs on their Web sites to attack the Worm.Explore.Zip virus , which enters machines in almost the same way as the recent Melissa virus -- by disguising itself as a friendly piece of e-mail
That virus attacks Windows 95 and 98 files , overwriting a computer 's hard drive destroys the memory that stores a computer 's setup , sometimes making a computer unbootable
Melissa , as the new viral vixen was named by its creator _ as yet unknown _ combines elements of both a computer virus ( spreading from file to file ) and a worm program ( spreading from computer to computer over a network )
Richard Smith hopes the FBI will try to find out 'd figured out the identity of an electronic criminal _ the malevolent hacker who 'd created the notorious Melissa computer virus neglected his successful software business is scheduled for arraignment on Monday will do hard time could identify its author by reading Melissa 's serial number got an e-mail Wednesday from Rishi Khan , a 19-year-old senior in computer engineering at the University of Delaware
Worm.Explore.Zip does not fit the technical definition of a computer virus targets computers using Microsoft Windows operating systems could prove more difficult to irradicate than the Melissa and Chernobyl viruses that struck earlier this spring by e-mail only
