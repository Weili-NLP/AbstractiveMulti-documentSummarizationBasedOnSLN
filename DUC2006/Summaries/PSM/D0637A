The province can now produce 300,000 sq. m. of solar panels for solar-energy heaters each year , giving an annual solar-energy output of 400 kilowatts has made marked progress in developing solar water heater , solar furnace , solar battery and basic theoretical research on the solar energy
Professor Xia Laifeng from Yunnan Teachers ' University , the solar energy research base in the province , said that they are studying the possibility of building `` solar energy houses , '' which use solar energy for heating and air conditioning , and are decorated with solar energy equipment
