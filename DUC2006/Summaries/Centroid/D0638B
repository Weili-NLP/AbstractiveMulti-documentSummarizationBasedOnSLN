 An analysis of striking scalloped fracture lines in the frozen surface of Jupiter's moon Europa has yielded the strongest evidence yet that a global ocean of liquid water once lay beneath the thick crust of ice, and may still be there.
Galileo has transmitted stunning pictures of the more than 100 erupting volcanoes on Io, and clear evidence that Ganymede is the only moon in the solar system to have its own magnetic field, and data showing that an ocean may lurk below Callisto's surface ice and, even more likely, in the depths of Europa.
 New evidence from NASA's Galileo spacecraft bolsters theories that a liquid ocean lies beneath the crust of Jupiter's moon Europa, scientists reported Monday after analyzing results from the probe's latest flyby.
 NASA's aging Galileo spacecraft flew within 380 miles of Jupiter's moon Io, exposing the craft to so much radiation that mission controllers feared the probe might not survive.
A team of researchers investigating the powerful magnetic field that pulsates around giant Jupiter reported Wednesday that a sophisticated instrument aboard their spacecraft has detected effects on the two Jovian moons that can best be explained by the existence of salty water conducting electricity beneath the mysterious satellites.
 Jupiter's moon Europa probably could not support life because oceans beneath the frozen surface could barely support single-cell organisms, let alone complex species such as those found on Earth, researchers said Thursday.
