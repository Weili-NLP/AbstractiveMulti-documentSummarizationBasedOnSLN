 Despite predictions that La Nina would bring Los Angeles a dry winter and possibly worsen the fire season, the weather phenomenon now appears to be losing strength, according to scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
The study appearing Friday in the journal Science has linked the warming of Pacific and Indian Ocean waters with increased rains in Africa and the periodic outbreaks of Rift Valley Fever, a mosquito-borne disease that can kill humans and animals.
The pool of cold Pacific water that is the heart of La Nina has shrunk to one-fourth the size it was in May, even as warm water left over from El Nino remains, said Bill Patzert, a researcher at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration laboratory in suburban Pasadena.
 La Nina, the assertive sister of last year's hellacious El Nino, has already contributed to freakish weather around the globe and will continue to bring colder than normal temperatures to the West Coast well into spring, according to government forecasters.
 Oklahoma's catastrophic tornadoes were influenced by La Nina, the weather phenomenon 5,000 miles west of the prairie in the Pacific Ocean, scientists say.
 Despite causing anomaly of weather and climate, the El Nino event may help cut global warming by temporarily stemming the release of carbon dioxide from the Pacific Ocean, scientists suggested Thursday.
