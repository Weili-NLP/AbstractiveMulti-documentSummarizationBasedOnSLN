 A federal judge Monday found President Clinton in civil contempt of court for lying in a deposition about the nature of his sexual relationship with former White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky.
The specific allegations contained in Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's Sept. 9 report to Congress refer to : Clinton's denial in his Jan. 17 deposition in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit that he ever had a sexual affair, a sexual relationship or sexual relations with Lewinsky.
Sexual relations were defined as when a person knowingly engages in or causes ... contact with the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks of any person with an intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person ... Clinton's insistence in his Aug. 17 grand jury testimony that his Jan. 17 answer narrowly fit the definition of sexual relations presented to him.
Defenders of President Clinton have argued that his accusers are overzealous in saying he should be impeached or subject to criminal charges on the grounds that he committed perjury when he denied in a civil deposition that he had a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
 The first two impeachment articles that the House will debate Thursday charge President Clinton with perjury in the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal.
Many Republicans say it is obvious that Clinton committed perjury, noting that he flatly denied any sexual relationship with Lewinsky.
