 President Vladimir Putin has decided to go forward with an operation to retrieve the bodies of 118 crewmen who died aboard a nuclear submarine that sank in the Barents Sea, Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov said Tuesday.
 A Russian general claimed Monday that rescuers located an object near the wrecked nuclear submarine Kursk that resembled equipment from a U.S. or British ship, but a navy spokesman denied any such discovery.
 President Clinton's national security adviser, Samuel Berger, has provided his Russian counterpart with a written summary of what U.S. naval and intelligence officials believe caused the nuclear-powered submarine Kursk to sink last month in the Barents Sea, officials said Wednesday.
 Britain plans to continue its bid to reach and rescue the 118 Russian sailors in a sunken submarine even though virtually all hope of finding survivors has faded, British Defence Ministry said here on Saturday.
 Norwegian divers opened the inner hatch of the sunken Russian nuclear-powered submarine Kursk's ninth unit at about 1 p.m. Moscow time 0900 GMT Monday, Russian media reported.
 The Russian navy struggled Monday to rescue more than 100 sailors trapped at the bottom of the Barents Sea in a submarine crippled by a major collision.
All previous attempts to dock a rescue capsule to the sub have failed and a seventh attempt was under way early Friday, the Interfax news agency reported, quoting Russian Northern Fleet spokesman Igor Babenko.
