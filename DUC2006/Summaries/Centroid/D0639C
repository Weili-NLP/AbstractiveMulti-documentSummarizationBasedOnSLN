 The United States believed that senior Iraqi scientists were helping to produce elements of the nerve agent VX at a factory in Khartoum that American cruise missiles destroyed last week, administration and intelligence officials said on Monday.
 Facing questions about the U.S. missile attack on a pharmaceutical plant in Sudan, the Clinton administration on Sunday sought to justify the strike by offering more details linking the factory to the production of chemical weapons.
Pentagon officials said Thursday that the administration had no evidence that the Yugoslav army or the Serbian forces had used, or were planning to use lethal chemical agents against either the ethnic Albanians they have been driving out of Kosovo or the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, which has been battling Yugoslav forces in the Serbian province.
Al Shifa pharmaceutical plant in Khartoum was attacked by the United States, alleging that its CIA intelligents had clandestinely collected soil samples from the plant site to find that these samples contained traces of Empta, a precursor used in the production of deadly VX nerve gas.
 The 22 Arab states at the United Nations have again asked the Security Council to approve a U.N. investigation of the U.S. attack on a factory in Sudan, according to a document released Wednesday.
 Iraq rejected as a fabrication Tuesday the contention by U.N. and chemical weapons experts that it had loaded the deadly nerve agent VX into missile warheads.
