Greenhouse gas emissions blamed for global warming may cause the collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and raise the average global sea level by four to six metres, beginning as early as the next century, a new scientific study predicted recently.
A U.N. scientific panel has predicted that unless these greenhouse gas emissions are reduced, the earth's average surface temperature will rise by some 2 to 6 degrees Fahrenheit over the next century, with a best estimate of about 3.5 degrees, compared with a rise of 5 to 9 degrees since the depths of the last ice age 18,000 to 20,000 years ago.
 Scientists looking for signs of global warming should spend more time scrutinizing Earth's weather circulation patterns, a new study suggests.
 Conditions like El Nino might settle in almost permanently if global warming gets bad enough, making climate disruptions such as droughts or excessive winter rain essentially the norm, a computer study suggests.
 There is neither evidence that global warming is a serious problem and nor truly cause to worry that emissions of waste industrial gases that trap heat like carbon dioxide could disrupt the world's climate, said an American scientist.
Ocean currents associated with El Nio are already known to make equatorial winds blow faster and boost the angular momentum of the atmosphere.
