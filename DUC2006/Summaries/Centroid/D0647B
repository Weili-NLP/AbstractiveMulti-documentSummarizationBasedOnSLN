-LRB- Williams, Cox News Service MOVED The legendary clout of Miami's exile community has never been so obvious as during its spirited, unified standoff against the U.S. government and Janet Reno, a former Miami hero.
In frantic last-minute negotiations, as the Justice Department prepared to order the transfer on Thursday morning in Florida, representatives of the Miami relatives and Juan Miguel Gonzalez, Elian's father, agreed to a meeting in the Washington, D.C., area, the officials said.
 The drama intensified Wednesday in the Elian Gonzalez saga as Cuban President Fidel Castro announced that the boy's father was ready to fly immediately to retrieve his son, while the US government extended its deadline for taking action to return the boy to Cuba.
 The relatives of Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old Cuban boy at the center of an international custody battle, decided Tuesday night to turn the boy over to his father on Wednesday at a meeting here, government officials said on Tuesday night.
