 Mercedes-Benz has recalled 6,000 high-tech child seats that automatically turn off passenger-side air bags when installed, saying a flaw in the system might keep the air bags turned on.
 The government should set up a nationwide network of fitting stations for child seats to help save children's lives in car crashes, the National Transportation Safety Board recommended Wednesday.
 Federal regulators Thursday warned consumers that side air bags can kill or seriously injure children under 12 and urged manufacturers installing the devices in rear seats to let drivers decide if they want them activated.
Under the new standards, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration will require air bags to protect vehicle occupants in a 25 mph crash test, the level supported by automakers, rather than a test at 30 mph favored by some consumer advocates.
 Ford Motor Company plans to add what it calls a rollover protection system in the fall of 2001 to its sport utility vehicles SUVs and light trucks in an effort to reduce fatalities, according to reports from the world's second biggest auto maker.
Since 1990, many General Motors and Ford cars and trucks have been equipped with a device similar to an airliner's black box, or flight data recorder, which automatically records the vehicle's speed, throttle setting, braking effort and engine rpm for each of the five seconds leading to an air-bag deployment.
