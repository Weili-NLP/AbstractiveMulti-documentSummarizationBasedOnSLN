 Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on Wednesday trashed President Clinton's plan to invest government funds in the stock market in order to produce more revenue for the Social Security retirement system.
Over the next five years, the measure would set aside at least $ 150 billion for tax cuts and the entire $ 1 trillion in projected Social Security surpluses for debt reduction, Republicans said.
 While tax breaks and many other budget matters are negotiable, President Clinton will veto legislation GOP leaders are promoting that would provide up to $ 800 billion in tax cuts, Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said Sunday.
The administration official, Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, the president's chief spokesman on Social Security, said a plan announced on Tuesday by Republicans in the House would make it more difficult to keep the retirement system solvent.
 The centerpiece of the Clinton administration's economic policy this year has been a demand that the Republican-controlled Congress forgo tax cuts and set aside the projected federal budget surplus until the nation shores up the Social Security system.
 President Clinton on Monday touted his $ 1.77 trillion blueprint for federal spending and its bailouts for Social Security and Medicare as relief for Generation X, which faces the risk of high federal taxes to subsidize the retirement of baby boomers.
