 Federal law enforcement officials said Saturday that they had obtained information tentatively linking an associate of Osama bin Laden, a wealthy Saudi businessman who has vowed to wage a holy war against the United States, to the bombing of the American embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed and Tanzanian Rashid Saleh Hemed were charged Sept. 21 in a Dar es Salaam magistrate's court with 11 counts of murder each in the bombing in which 11 people, all Africans, died.
 The United States is concerned over more terrorist attacks by forces of Osama bin Laden, the man allegedly linked with last year's U.S. embassy bombings in Africa, CIA Director George Tenet said Tuesday.
 An Egyptian formally charged in the Aug. 7 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Dar es Salaam has been providing investigators with a lot of information but has been less than forthcoming about his role in the blast, sources close to the investigation say.
 Federal prosecutors charged Wednesday that the American Embassy in Tanzania was attacked by at least six men who detonated a bomb packed with car batteries and oxygen tanks, apparently to enhance the lethal force of the explosion.
 A refrigerator truck transported the bomb that killed at least 11 people and extensively damaged the U.S. Embassy in Dar es Salaam, the FBI said Friday.
