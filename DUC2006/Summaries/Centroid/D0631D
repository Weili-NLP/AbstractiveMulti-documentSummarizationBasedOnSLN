 French investigators looking into the crash last month of an Air France Concorde said Thursday it was probable that a 16-inch piece of metal found on the runway caused a tire to blow out, sending debris from the tire through fuel tanks and triggering a fire that brought down the plane.
 A metal strip that investigators believe may have led to the fiery crash of an Air France Concorde last July apparently came from a Continental Airlines DC10 that had taken off from the same runway only minutes before the Concorde, the French agency investigating the disaster said on Monday.
 The doomed Air France Concorde apparently lost power in two of its four engines as it was taking off, and the flight crew was unable to retract the aircraft's landing gear, government investigators said Thursday.
 French investigators met Thursday to try to determine what new safety measures are required before Air France can resume its Concorde flights, grounded since one of its supersonic jets crashed in flames outside Paris.
 British aviation authorities on Wednesday formally ruled the Concorde supersonic airliner unfit to fly unless its manufacturers took steps to prevent the problems that led to last month's fatal Air France Concorde crash near Paris.
 Joined by Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, relatives of the 113 people killed in the Concorde crash gathered Friday in Cologne's 750-year-old cathedral and were asked : Has mankind reached too far?
