 Conservatives won a major victory in Kansas on Wednesday when the state Board of Education approved new science standards that dilute the teaching of evolution.
 When Kansas Board of Education member Steve Abrams called John Staver to Topeka two weeks ago, Staver thought they were going to iron out some problems with proposed science standards.
 Sitting at their students desks two days before the start of the new school year, four high school biology teachers here were hashing over the vote of the Kansas Board of Education, earlier this month, to delete virtually any mention of evolution from the state's recommended science curriculum and its standardized tests.
 Bucking recent changes in Kansas and other states that allow public schools to teach alternative views of human development, the New Mexico Board of Education voted overwhelmingly on Friday to limit the statewide science curriculum to the teaching of evolution.
 The Supreme Court refused to let a public school district require that the teaching of evolution be accompanied by a disclaimer mentioning the biblical version of creation and other teachings on life's origin.
The standards, written by a state committee of science teachers and university professors, would determine what Kansas schoolchildren learn and are tested on.
