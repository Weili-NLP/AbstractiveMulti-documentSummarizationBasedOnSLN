 A police chief of a southern Chinese city where a reputed Hong Kong crime boss is on trial has stepped up security following assassination threats by gang members, Hong Kong newspapers reported Saturday.
 Law enforcement officers staged about two dozen raids and arrested 15 people for alleged money laundering in connection with a cross-border gang, police said Wednesday.
Undersecretary for Security Brig. Manuel Monge described the explosions as an act of intimidation by gang members, and said Macau's police would double their work in defense of the population and the territory's stability.
The Portuguese authorities have been anxious to see Wan sentenced ever since he was arrested on May 1, 1998, the same day that his gang allegedly planted a bomb under the car of Macau's police superintendent.
Hong Kong newspapers also reported that Cheung was behind a bizarre plan to kidnap Anson Chan, Hong Kong's chief secretary, as a way to win the release of a fellow gangster, Yip Kai-foon.
Whether Cheung's arrest came about by pressure on the police from Jiang, by a rare case of successful cooperation between Guangdong and Hong Kong police, or simply by a lucky break, may never become public.
All of the arrests were made in the mainland after six months of investigations carried out with the support and cooperation of the Hong Kong police, Zhang said at a news conference in Beijing.
