Many observers warn that a new tough love campaign by Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien, a French Quebecer deeply opposed to separatism, represents a monumental political blunder one that risks giving Bouchard and his secessionist supporters the lift they need.
We also sought a mandate to get conditions for a winning referendum on Quebec sovereignty, Bouchard said of the referendum issue.
Bouchard appeared to have had more difficulty than expected defeating the provincial Liberal Party leader, Jean Charest, on whom many people in English Canada had pinned their hopes for an end to the French-speaking province's 30 years of threats to separate.
In Ottawa late Monday night, Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien said his government will cooperate with the re-elected Bouchard government if the latter respected the desire of Quebecers to improve economic conditions.
At the same time, popular support for the separatists provincial government, headed by Premier Lucien Bouchard, fell to the lowest point in its five-year history, around 37 percent.
The federal government has refused to specify what it means by a clear majority, although the National Post newspaper, quoting unnamed Chretien government sources, reported recently that Ottawa would not accept Quebec's secession unless the separatists win 60 percent of the vote.
In his campaign, Charest has accused Bouchard of recklessly pursuing another referendum even though opinion polls show that Quebecers overwhelmingly oppose it.
