Then, there is the serious Bush.
ON THE DEATH PENALTY : Leaving Appeals To Higher Power &QL; Bush has strongly supported the death penalty and he has presided over a record 98 executions as governor, according to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.
In his five years as governor of Texas, the state has executed far more than any other state.
At a time when the well-publicized releases of dozens of death row inmates found innocent by DNA testing has sparked a national movement for a moratorium on capital punishment, and led to a slight downtick in support for the practice in public opinion polls, foes of the death penalty hope to use the upcoming primary season to publicize their cause and pressure Bush to intervene on behalf of those scheduled to die.
In five years in office, he has overseen the executions of 113 death row inmates, more than any other governor in any state since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976.
I do n't believe in death.
Ten days later, the board voted to recommend clemency for the first time under Bush, and the governor commuted Lucas sentence to life in prison.
Innocent people are almost certainly being killed because of the death penalty.
We're doing so in the state of Texas.
