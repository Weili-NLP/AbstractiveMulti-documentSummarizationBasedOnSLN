 Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on Wednesday trashed President Clinton's plan to invest government funds in the stock market in order to produce more revenue for the Social Security retirement system.
House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, slammed Clinton's budget for using $ 1 trillion in projected surplus money for new programs rather than tax cuts.
And in the six years since, first as a top economic adviser and since 1995 as the Treasury secretary, Rubin has gained much credit in a close partnership with Federal Reserve Chairman Alan for the policies of spending restraint that kept interest rates low, Wall Street booming and many Americans raking in money.
My preference is that the surpluses be returned as tax cuts so the government share of the economy will shrink and the private share of the economy will expand, said Lawrence Kudlow, a former Reagan administration economist who is now with American Skandia, an investment firm.
Gene Sperling, director of the White House's National Economic Council, said the Republicans tax cut plan would take money that could be better used to bolster Social Security and Medicare when the large baby boom generation begins retiring in 2011.
Clinton's plan includes $ 34 billion in tax cuts over five years, $ 39 billion in increased spending over the current fiscal year and projects a record $ 117 billion surplus.
