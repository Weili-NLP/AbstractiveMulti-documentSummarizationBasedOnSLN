The Kursk was just five years old.
Navy officials declined to say how far down the vessel was trapped, but a Norwegian report said the Kursk was some 450 feet down, a depth at which rescue would be difficult because of the crushing water pressure.
Rescuers aborted their first attempt to retrieve the sailors because a storm prevented them from attaching the rescue capsule to an escape hatch, the Itar-Tass news agency quoted navy officials as saying.
The Russian Navy announced Saturday that most of the crew apparently died when a massive explosion shattered the Kursk on August 12, slamming it to the bottom of the sea.
 Six days after something went dreadfully wrong with the Russian nuclear submarine Kursk, another submarine quietly pulled into a Norwegian port, carrying some of the most detailed evidence so far of why the pride of Russia's Navy sank to the bottom of the Barents Sea.
NATO officials said Thursday's meeting between Russians and NATO delegates in Brussels include a telephone link-up with British submarine rescue experts in Morthwood, England, and a wider discussion about the angle at which the Kursk was lying on the seabed, the water and the weather conditions, and other organizational and technical matters.
 The Russian navy struggled Monday to rescue more than 100 sailors trapped at the bottom of the Barents Sea in a submarine crippled by a major collision.
