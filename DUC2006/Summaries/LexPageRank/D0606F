The answer, many experts believe, may depend on how much fresh water flows into the North Atlantic Ocean as a result of melting Arctic ice and the runoff from an increase in Northern Hemisphere precipitation that some scientists say is already resulting from global warming.
Researchers predict that anticipated increases in water temperature caused by a double of carbon dioxide will eliminate most, if not all, suitable habitat for Pacific sockeye salmon, and possibly for other salmon species as well, the report says.
The Greenpeace report noted that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group of 1,600 climate scientists from around the world, said Arctic sea ice has decreased 2.8 percent each decade since the late 1970s.
Greenhouse gas emissions blamed for global warming may cause the collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and raise the average global sea level by four to six metres, beginning as early as the next century, a new scientific study predicted recently.
Researchers evaluated data from 100 separate studies of environmental factors in North America, Europe and Asia, including air temperature measurements, air circulation, precipitation, sea ice, glaciers and plant growth.
The report, the health segment of the U.S. National Assessment of the Potential Consequences of Climate Variability and Change, also warns that more people could get sick from contaminated water.
