Infected birds indicate that the virus is present.
How do people get West Nile encephalitis?
The publicity about the West Nile virus and counties intensified mosquito control efforts have prompted more residents to call about dead crows they have found, which has led to more testing, said Dennis McGowan, a spokesman for the state Department of Health and Senior Services.
Humans usually get the disease from mosquito bites when the population of infected city birds is sufficiently large to infect enough mosquitoes.
It is spread to people by mosquitoes.
In addition to getting rid of standing water, officials recommend wearing bug repellent limiting time spent outside to hours when mosquitoes are inactive.
 A dead crow that had been infected with West Nile virus was found in the city, health authorities said Wednesday, confirming that the exotic encephalitis virus has migrated here and prompting officals to calmly warn the public to protect themselves against mosquitoes.
And in New Jersey on Monday, tests showed that six more crows found dead there were also infected with the virus, including the one found in Union County, state health officials said, bringing the total found infected so far this year in that state to 15 according to the state health department.
