Carl Schmid, an alternative GOP delegate to the GOP convention from Washington, D.C., who serves on the board of the Human Rights Campaign, the largest gay rights advocacy organization in the nation, said he was meeting with Bush in an effort to improve the understanding of gay people and gay issues within the Republican party.
A spokesman for Texas Gov. George Bush, who is expected to win the presidential nomination at the convention, replied that Arizona Rep. Jim Kolbe's sexual orientation has nothing to do with his scheduled speech on free trade.
David Hanson, a leader of Log Cabin Republicans in California from San Juan Capistrano, Calif., wrote to Bush last week to complain that the exclusive meeting with gay Republicans in Austin was merely an effort to end the media story rather than an attempt to deal forthrightly with the issues that concern gay civil rights activists.
Buchanan and other conservative candidates have not changed their views, and even Bush, McCain and Mrs. Dole have not embraced a broader gay agenda that also includes adoptions by gays and a less punitive approach toward gays in the military.
Beyond the politics, the legislation offered by Rep. Lynn Woolsey, D-Calif., spotlighted the uneasy relationship between the federal government and the Boy Scouts since the organization's stance toward gays became a national issue.
