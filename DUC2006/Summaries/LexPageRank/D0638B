Galileo has transmitted stunning pictures of the more than 100 erupting volcanoes on Io, and clear evidence that Ganymede is the only moon in the solar system to have its own magnetic field, and data showing that an ocean may lurk below Callisto's surface ice and, even more likely, in the depths of Europa.
 New evidence from NASA's Galileo spacecraft bolsters theories that a liquid ocean lies beneath the crust of Jupiter's moon Europa, scientists reported Monday after analyzing results from the probe's latest flyby.
On the drawing boards at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory are plans for a spacecraft to orbit Europa, perhaps as early as 2008, and to use radar to probe for the ocean that may lie deep in the icy moon.
 NASA's aging Galileo spacecraft flew within 380 miles of Jupiter's moon Io, exposing the craft to so much radiation that mission controllers feared the probe might not survive.
As for Jupiter's moon Europa, images of icebergs on the icy crust that were beamed down from the spacecraft after it reached the planet in January of 1995 revealed strange patches of yellow and brown matter that many scientists argue must indicate the the possible precursors of life in a warm ocean miles beneath the ice.
In coming years, scientists and engineers at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration hope to launch a robotic probe to the Jovian moon Europa.
