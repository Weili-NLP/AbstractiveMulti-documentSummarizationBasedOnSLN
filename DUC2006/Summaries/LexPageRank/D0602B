 East Germany's former sports chief and his medical director were convicted Tuesday for their roles in a top secret doping program in the former communist country that turned promising young female athletes into souped-up Olympic champions.
Tennis is a sport I would not have thought would be steroid-involved, but there's tons of steroids out there these days, and they're not all coming from the black market, said Dr. Alan Jones, a pharmaceutics professor at the University of Mississippi who acts as the toxicology consultant for the company that administers drug testing for the men's ATP and women's WTA tours and for the ITF.
Former U.S. Olympic track coach Pat Connolly has told a Senate judiciary committee she believes at least 40 percent of the U.S. women's team in Seoul had probably used steroids at sometime in their preparation for the Games.
 Two medical experts testifying Wednesday in the doping trial of a former East German sports doctor said the female swimmers they examined showed health damage linked to performance-enhancing drugs, including liver damage and excessive facial hair.
It was for these people, the very sick, that steroids were developed, he said, not for healthy athletes seeking to build bigger muscles to improve their athletic performance.
The fact is that at least 23 Chinese athletes, mostly women, have tested positive for steroids since 1990.
