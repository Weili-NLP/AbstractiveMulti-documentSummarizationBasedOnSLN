The statement by the law firm said the U.S. government has retreated systematically from declarations that high officials made two years ago to justify the attack on the plant, except for the claim that a chemical component of VX nerve gas known as Empta was found in a soil sample taken by a foreign agent near the plant.
Tuesday, administration officials said the pharmaceutical plant was not the only installation in Sudan suspected of producing chemicals for VX, but rather the one where the United States had the most persuasive evidence.
Defense Secretary William Cohen said in a press conference Thursday that the administration had bombed the Shifa Chemical Complex in Northeast Khartoum in the Sudan because the intelligence community was confident that the plant was involved in the production of chemical weapons agents, including precursor chemicals for deadly V-series of nerve agents, like, for example, VX.
Soil sample from the plant site showed traces of EMPTA, a manmade chemical that has no commercial uses and is a key ingredient in the deadly nerve agent VX, U.S. intelligence officials said.
Facing questions about the decision to bomb the factory, senior administration officials said on Monday that a soil sample collected nearby provided irrefutable evidence of the presence of VX at the plant.
The United States has said a U.N. investigation is unnecessary because U.S. intelligence showed the El Shifa plant produced chemical weapons.
