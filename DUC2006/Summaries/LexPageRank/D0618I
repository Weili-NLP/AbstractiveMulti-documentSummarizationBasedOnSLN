A paper presented at the conference by Dr. Martin Cetron of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and associates reported on research, not yet complete, into the deaths of three people who had received yellow fever vaccine.
But researchers from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and from India have created a multipronged vaccine designed to make the immune system fight the parasite at many stages : When the mosquito bite sends it into the body, when it invades the liver and when infection moves into the bloodstream.
Dr. Tore Godal of Norway, a tropical medicine expert who is now acting director of the anti-malaria program, said in an interview that one of the best hopes of finding medicine to cure the disease may be in a plant cultivated in China and used there and in Vietnam as a very effective treatment.
The conference this week in Abuja, Nigeria, is sponsored by the World Health Organization and will draw together U.N. agencies, the World Bank, Western donors and the heads of 20 African countries in a Roll Back Malaria campaign that hopes to halve deaths from malaria, a mosquito-borne disease, within 10 years.
Another eight clinical trials in countries in Africa, Asia, South America and Europe concluded Malarone is an effective malaria treatment, too.
