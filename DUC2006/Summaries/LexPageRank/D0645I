The legislation is also expected to give housing authorities greater flexibility in setting rents on the nation's 1.2 million public housing units, authorize mayors in some cities to take over poorly run housing authorities and allow low-income people to use federal housing vouchers to help pay the costs of buying a house.
The report, issued by Andrew Cuomo, the U.S. secretary of housing and urban development, said that 5.4 million low-income families pay more than half their incomes for housing or live in dilapidated units, an increase of 12 percent since the economic expansion began in 1991.
Some property owners are dropping out of federal affordable housing subsidy programs in which low-income people pay about 30 percent of their income as rent.
The administration's budget request seeks to aid those people with a holistic economic approach, using urban programs that would stimulate job growth, improve public schools and educational programs and create 100,000 new vouchers for low-income city residents so they can move closer to higher-paying jobs.
&QL; But with the disappearance of federal money to build new low and moderate-income housing, local governments have asked housing agencies to create home-ownership programs for working people in need of housing, said Robert Davis, executive director of the Snohomish County Housing Authority.
One would create about 15,000 new Section 8 housing vouchers, which are federal rent subsidies for low-income tenants.
