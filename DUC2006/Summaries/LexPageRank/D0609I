After learning that Israeli Housing and Construction Ministry has issued tenders for building 2,600 new houses for Jewish settlers in West Bank settlements, the Peace Now group said this action will cause more trouble for the Israeli-Palestinian final-status talks The number of new tenders issued by the ministry exceeds the total number issued in the three years tenure of the previous government led by Benjamin Netanyahu, the satement added.
The Peace Now group, which advocates the creation of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza, said the settlers refusal to build fences showed that their opposition to a land-for-peace deal with the Palestinians was not based on security concerns, as they claim.
Peace Now, an Israeli group opposed to the government's settlement policy, visited all but two of Israel's 144 settlements in the West Bank and Gaza on Wednesday and counted 5,892 units under construction.
They were angry with Barak for approving the construction of 2,600 new housing units this week in four settlements near Jerusalem, saying the settlement expansion could prevent the start of the final status talks and destroy the peace process.
Netanyahu's planned visit to Ariel came as U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was wrapping up an attempt to try to move Israeli and Palestinian leaders toward agreement over a long-delayed Israeli pullback from part of the West Bank.
