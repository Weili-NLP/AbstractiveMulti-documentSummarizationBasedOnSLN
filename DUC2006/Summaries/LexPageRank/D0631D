 The flight may not be as comfortable as business class on a 747 and it does not offer a choice of a dozen movies but crossing the Atlantic in just over three hours on the supersonic Concorde, versus seven to nine hours on standard jets, is well worth the cost and relative discomfort, Concorde passengers said Wednesday.
Air France grounded its remaining five Concordes immediately after the July 25 crash near Paris that killed 113 people.
The swan-like supersonic aircraft also left pieces of tire on the runway and had dropped debris along the 4-mile trajectory of its brief flight, the French Bureau of Accident Investigation, or BEA, also said in a statement.
While those decisions were being made on July 25 in the 77 seconds between 4:43:13 p.m., when the controller spotted the fire, and 4:44:30, when the last sound was recorded, amateur photographers on the highways below were capturing the flight's death throes : a Concorde filled with German tourists hoping to be on a supersonic rendezvous with a New York cruise ship was seen fatally crippled, spewing flames and smoke as it roared low over the suburbs and farms north of Paris.
 French investigators met Thursday to try to determine what new safety measures are required before Air France can resume its Concorde flights, grounded since one of its supersonic jets crashed in flames outside Paris.
