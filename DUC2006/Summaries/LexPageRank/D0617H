 Investigators from the United States and Egypt will review part of the flight control system in the tail of Boeing's 767 airplane as part of the investigation into the crash of EgyptAir Flight 990, the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board said Friday.
The co-pilot said that he saw a fireball like a shooting star passing ahead at the Jordanian plane very close from right to left going down, the pilot wrote, as cited by Egyptian investigators in the NTSB documents.
All 217 people aboard the plane were killed.
It would have recorded crew conversations in the jet's cockpit during the final 30 minutes of flight, and could prove to be even more important than the flight data recorder in helping investigators determine the cause of the crash.
 National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Jim Hall said Friday that additional studies must be completed before his agency can determine the cause of the EgyptAir 990 crash, and he disputed an Associated Press report that investigators are increasingly convinced the jet was crashed deliberately.
Hall said the NTSB and the Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority had agreed this week to continue studying the accident, including the voice and data recorders.
The pilot of Flight RJ262 from New York's John F. Kennedy airport on October 31 last year reported that his co-pilot made the sighting shortly after the takeoff while he had his head down.
