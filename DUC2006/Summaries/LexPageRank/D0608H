This car is, without a doubt, the safest Volvo ever built, thanks to innovations including computerized stability and traction control, advanced antilock braking, new seats that offer much-improved whiplash protection in rear-end crashes, and the inflatable curtain, Volvo's version of the side airbag system to protect the driver and front passenger in the event of a T-bone collision.
Since children under 12 are supposed to be traveling in rear seats at all times, the advisory urged car manufacturers to deactivate rear side air bags before shipping vehicles to dealers.
While some auto makers, including Mercedes, Volvo and BMW have air bag curtains that inflate across the car windows and could potentially help during a rollover, experts believe Ford's is the first that is designed specifically for rollover protection.
Connolly said this data would let auto manufacturers such as GM design better vehicles to protect passengers by understanding how drivers react to crashes.
The company's move follows a recommendation by the National Transportation Safety Board in January that a nationwide network of fitting stations for child seats be established to prevent the deaths of children in automobile accidents.
 Federal regulators Thursday warned consumers that side air bags can kill or seriously injure children under 12 and urged manufacturers installing the devices in rear seats to let drivers decide if they want them activated.
