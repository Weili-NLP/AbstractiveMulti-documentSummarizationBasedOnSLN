To him, evolution is none of these things.
Kansas last year rekindled the issue of teaching evolution in public schools when the state board of education, lead by Holloway, approved science teaching standards that minimized the importance of evolution and omitted the big-bang theory of the origin of the universe.
Of course evolution is a theory.
Judging from the agitation in the state over evolution, there is evidence she has succeeded : In the beginning, the Kansas Board of Education and the state education commissioner appointed a 27-member committee of science teachers and professors to write new science standards for public schools.
But Charles Darwin's theory still faces challenges in the nation's classrooms from increasingly sophisticated creationists, state and local school boards that leave evolution out of science education, and many biology teachers who themselves reject evolution.
 Sitting at their students desks two days before the start of the new school year, four high school biology teachers here were hashing over the vote of the Kansas Board of Education, earlier this month, to delete virtually any mention of evolution from the state's recommended science curriculum and its standardized tests.
Abrams said that in thinking about the Kansas standards he had been struck by Humphreys book, Starlight and Time : Solving the Puzzle of Distant Starlight in a Young Universe Master Books, fifth printing in 1998.
