Not the children who need families ... or the Americans who want children.
Passed by the standing committee of the National People's Congress, the revised law reduces the age of prospective Chinese parents from 35 to 30 years, drops a restriction that couples be childless and allows for multiple adoptions, the Xinhua News Agency reported.
Among its major provisions, the treaty would : establish the first global standards intended to protect children from being sold and improve procedures for finding them homes ; prevent coercion of birth parents by unscrupulous practitioners who want their children ; and set guidelines to cut red tape and otherwise steamline the process for adoptive parents.
In the last few years, the media have focused on global dramas highlighting the plight of children needing homes : Chinese girls abandoned in markets by parents encumbered by the country's one-child policy and its preference for boys ; Romanian children orphaned by revolution or left in understaffed institutions by their impoverished parents ; Russian children stranded in dismal state orphanages, in a society that widely stigmatizes adoption.
Intercountry adoption split wide open the notion of secrecy, because people could n't pretend anymore that they could n't see the differences between parents and their children, said Susan Soon-Keum Cox, a Holt International vice president who in 1956 became one of the first Korean orphans to be adopted by Americans.
