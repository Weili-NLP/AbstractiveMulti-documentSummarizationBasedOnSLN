David L. Smith, 30, of Aberdeen, N.J., was arrested Friday and charged with originating the destructive Melissa, which infected hundreds of thousands of computers and swamped hundreds of companies e-mail systems.
If the infected machine had a copy of Microsoft's Outlook e-mail program, Melissa would send a copy of itself to the first 50 people in the Outlook address book.
Melissa showed up Friday and spread rapidly around the world on Monday like a malicious chain letter, causing affected computers to fire off dozens of infected messages to friends and colleagues and swamping e-mail systems.
The Melissa macro or W97M Melissa virus spreads via infected e-mail and attacks computers loaded with Microsoft's widely used or Computer Carnegie Mellon's Department of Defense-funded computer security team.
Unlike the recent Melissa scare, which automatically propagated via e-mail, this virus does n't spread as quickly because it requires a person to launch an infected program file to contaminate a computer.
But, thanks to the run-ins with the Melissa and Chernobyl viruses earlier this spring, computer systems managers reacted more quickly when word of Worm.Explore.Zip began to spread.
Melissa HOW IT WORKS : Makes its way into computers as an e-mail attachment and then sends itself around the Internet using addresses found in a recipient's computerized address book.
