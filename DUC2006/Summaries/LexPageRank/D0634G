While the fisheries service is expected to recommend waiting for several years before a decision is made, the Environmental Protection Agency told the corps recently that the four dams harmed the river's water quality, endangered the salmon and might have to be breached to comply with the federal Clean Water Act.
 Lending political momentum to an idea that would have been unthinkable in a different era of Pacific Northwest history, Gov. John A. Kitzhaber of Oregon announced Friday that he favored breaching four large federal dams on Washington state's Snake River in an effort to restore endangered salmon populations.
It is a good deal because conservation means more fish for the future, said Canadian Fisheries Minister David Anderson.
But with the river's coho salmon already declared extinct, and every other species of Snake River salmon and steelhead now listed under the Endangered Species Act, the once-unthinkable idea of breaching the dams has emerged in several federal studies as the action with the best chance of restoring healthy salmon runs.
In a way, this issue about the difference in survival of transported fish versus fish that migrate through the river is a red herring, said Rob Masonis, regional director of hydropower programs for American Rivers, a conservation group.
Scott Hamelberg, who supervises north state fish projects for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, said agency biologists are addressing Coleman's problems.
