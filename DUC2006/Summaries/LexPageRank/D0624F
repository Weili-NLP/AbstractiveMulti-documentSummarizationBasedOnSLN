 Britain's Home Secretary Jack Straw unveiled new curbs Wednesday to combat police racism in the country after a damning report on ther murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence.
The report comes less than a week after an inquiry highlighted institutional racism in London's Metropolitan Police following the bungled investigation into the murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence.
The report is expected to present a damning portrait of police incompetence and racial prejudice, and to conclude that the Metropolitan Police, Britain's largest police force, is guilty of pervasive institutional racism.
Fred Broughton, chairman of the police federation of England and Wales, which represents rank and file police officers, said he does not believe the Metropolitan Police is institutionally racist and called Macpherson's report grossly unfair.
