GM's new strategy, and particularly Wednesday's plan for new assembly plants, represents a challenge to the United Automobile Workers union, which last week settled a strike of nearly two months at two auto parts factories in Flint, Mich..
Auto analysts said a strike there would ripple across North America within days, quickly shutting most of the 22 assembly plants not yet affected by the metal-stamping plant strike, causing hundreds of temporary layoffs at independent parts supply companies and depleting dealer inventories of cars and trucks.
Key issues in talks to replace the current contract are certain to include job security, particularly for workers at auto parts subsidiaries that are being spun off, as well as modest changes to the automakers health care plans and other employee benefits, executives and union officials said in interviews and public appearances in recent weeks.
The triennial contract talks with Detroit's automakers began Monday at Ford Motor Co. and were followed Tuesday by an initial meeting at DaimlerChrysler AG.
Yokich said Mercedes-Benz, the German luxury car unit of DaimlerChrysler that operates a nonunion assembly plant in Alabama, should be under the UAW contract.
It need only look to rival Ford Motor Co., which has not had a national contract strike in 23 years and is the industry's poster company for good union relations.
