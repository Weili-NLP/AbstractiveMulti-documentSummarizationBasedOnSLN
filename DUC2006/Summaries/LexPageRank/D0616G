As they suffer major losses following the federal offensive, Chechen rebels are planning more terrorist acts in Russia, Interfax quoted the Interior Ministry and the Federal Security Service as saying Sunday in a communique.
Russia began its military operations in Chechnya in late September after Chechen rebels armed incursions into the neighboring republic of Dagestan and a spate of apartment building blasts that claimed over 300 people in Moscow and two other Russian cities.
Normal, peaceful life for this part of the Russian population ... will be restored, Col. Gen. Valery Manilov, deputy chief of Russia's general staff, told a news conference in Moscow Thursday, hours after President Vladimir Putin reprimanded officials for lax security in the war-torn region.
 Russia's campaign against Islamic rebels in Chechnya moved closer to full-scale war Thursday as federal forces entered the breakaway Caucasus region where Moscow suffered a humiliating and costly defeat three years ago.
 Chechen rebels have been shooting at Russian federal military and police posts in Chechnya and at local polling stations set up for Sunday's presidential elections, the Interfax news agency reported Saturday.
The Defense Ministry believes that Chechen rebels intend to let federal troops into Chechnya and then launch large-scale retribution actions while staging subversive and terrorist acts in the three Russian border regions of Daghestan, Stavropol and Krasnodar.
