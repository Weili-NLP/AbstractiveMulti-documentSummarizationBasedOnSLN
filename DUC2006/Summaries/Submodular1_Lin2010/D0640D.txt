There was no news Thursday about the 118 men trapped since Saturday at the bottom of the Barents Sea aboard the Kursk, one of the newest and most powerful nuclear submarines in the Russian navy.
The Kursk was just five years old.
Russian officials said the Kursk was not carrying nuclear weapons.
 Russian Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov said Thursday that collision with a big object caused the Kursk nuclear submarine to sink to the bottom of the Barents Sea.
The Kursk was commissioned for the Russian Navy in 1995.

 The Russian navy struggled Monday to rescue more than 100 sailors trapped at the bottom of the Barents Sea in a submarine crippled by a major collision.
