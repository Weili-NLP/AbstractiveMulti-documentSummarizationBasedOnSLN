Another safety agency, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, says more than 80 percent of child car seats are used improperly.
The system was designed to reduce the dangers of small children in child seats near air bags.
 The government should set up a nationwide network of fitting stations for child seats to help save children's lives in car crashes, the National Transportation Safety Board recommended Wednesday.
 Cars should be designed with child safety first in mind, especially in the back seat where most children ride, the head of a federal safety agency says.
Another recent change came about because of injuries and deaths to children caused by air bags activating in the front seat.
It's time to put children and their safety first in vehicle design, Hall said.
By next year, DaimlerChrysler will have the capacity to conduct 800,000 inspections annually to make sure children are buckled properly in child seats and child seats are properly installed in both new and older DaimlerChrysler vehicles, the company officials said.
More air bags, though, are on the way.
When children are in the car, they ride in the back seat about 70 percent of the time, according to the agency's analysis of federal crash data from 1996 and 1997.
Hall said crash tests that automakers must pass for federal safety compliance should include child dummies in the back seats to learn how well the vehicles protect them from head and neck injuries.
