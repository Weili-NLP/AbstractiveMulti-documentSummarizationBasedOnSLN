The UAW's deal with Ford also allows the automaker to spin-off its Visteon Automotive Systems, with 23,500 UAW workers, into a separate company.
 With General Motors, Ford Motor and DaimlerChrysler scheduled to begin talks next week with the United Automobile Workers, it appears increasingly likely that negotiators will seek a national labor contract lasting four or more years, the longest such deal since the 1950s, auto executives and union officials said.
UAW hit Delphi with two strikes last summer that shut down GM's North American assembly plants and cost Delphi $ 450 million.
The largest issue between Ford and the union appears to be Ford's plans for Visteon and the unit's 23,500 UAW workers.
The plants would use far less labor than current assembly plants as outside suppliers, many of them with nonunion workers, would do much work previously done by GM employees.
The last national strike by the UAW against Ford was 1976 ; it was also the last time the UAW struck during negotiations.
The UAW has not held a national strike in years, but has held several local strikes at GM, including a 54-day strike at two Flint plants last summer that shut down most of the company's North American production.
GM's new strategy, and particularly Wednesday's plan for new assembly plants, represents a challenge to the United Automobile Workers union, which last week settled a strike of nearly two months at two auto parts factories in Flint, Mich..
