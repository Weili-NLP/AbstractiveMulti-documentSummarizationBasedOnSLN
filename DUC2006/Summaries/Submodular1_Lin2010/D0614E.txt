If Bouchard and his Parti Quebecois win, the election would be very likely to be followed by another referendum on Quebec's future.
 Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien has ruled out the possibility that the French-speaking province of Quebec could declare independence even if a majority of Quebeckers vote for secession in the next referendum.
Quebec premier Lucien Bouchard will have a problem if he promises another referendum in the next election because people in Quebec do n't want any referendum, Chretien said.
Recent polls also indicated that more than 60 percent of Quebec people did not want to see another referendum in the near future.
But I could vote for Bouchard.
 Quebec's ruling Parti Quebecois PQ won enough seats to form a majority government in Monday's general election in the French-speaking province of Canada.
The people of Quebec, like the people of all of Canada, want this country of ours to work and be a success whatever government it has, Charest said.
The separatist government in Quebec said they would hold another referendum if they are re-elected in a provincial election, which is expected next year.
The province has been seeking independence from Canada since a near victory for separatists in a 1995 independence referendum.
Quebec is the only Canadian province with a French majority, 80 percent of 7.3 million people, and surveys have shown that about two-thirds of French speakers support either outright secession or some degree of sovereignty from the rest of Canada.
