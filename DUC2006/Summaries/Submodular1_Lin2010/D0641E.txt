Could this be related to global warming?
Greenhouse gas emissions including carbon dioxide created by the burning of coal, gas and oil, are believed by most atmospheric scientists to cause the warming of the Earth's surface and a change in the global climate.
Greenhouse gas emissions blamed for global warming may cause the collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and raise the average global sea level by four to six metres, beginning as early as the next century, a new scientific study predicted recently.
The panel also predicted that if emissions of the gases are not reduced, the average global temperature will increase by 1.8 degrees to 6.3 degrees Fahrenheit.
They said that the changes are caused by a temperature increase, which is one of the effects of global warming.
Over the past 50 years, the Earth's average temperature has been increasing by around 0.79 C per century.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a U.N.-sponsored network of more than 2,000 scientists monitoring the global climate, has concluded that there is a discernible human influence on the climate through the burning of fossil fuels, which produce greenhouse gases.
For that reason, slightly higher rates of warming and sea level rise related to warming are expected, according to a climate study written by Wigley and released June 29 by the Pew Center on Global Climate Change in Washington.
Records of surface air temperature have been the main measure of global warming, says Abarca del Rio.
