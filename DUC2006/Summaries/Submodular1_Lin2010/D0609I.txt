The other tenders were for several Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza reached 200, with settlers to be 170,000 by the end of the year 2000.

 In defiance of fresh U.S. criticism over increasing Jewish settlement activities in the West Bank, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Monday pledged to further expand settlement construction.
