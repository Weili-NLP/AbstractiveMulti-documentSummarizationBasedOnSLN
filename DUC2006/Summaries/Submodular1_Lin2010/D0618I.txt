Experts say 90 percent of malaria cases are in sub-Saharan Africa.
In fact, Ruebush said, 90 percent of all malaria infections and 90 percent of malaria deaths occur in Africa.
About 550 million people in the African region risk the disease.
The conference this week in Abuja, Nigeria, is sponsored by the World Health Organization and will draw together U.N. agencies, the World Bank, Western donors and the heads of 20 African countries in a Roll Back Malaria campaign that hopes to halve deaths from malaria, a mosquito-borne disease, within 10 years.
A paper presented at the conference by Dr. Martin Cetron of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and associates reported on research, not yet complete, into the deaths of three people who had received yellow fever vaccine.
In spite of drug resistance, malaria is a curable disease, it said, adding that research and development in malaria prevention and treatment have made advances.
Another eight clinical trials in countries in Africa, Asia, South America and Europe concluded Malarone is an effective malaria treatment, too.
The declaration said African countries support fully the implementation of the Global and Regional Strategy and approaches recommended by the World Health Organization.
This year, the conference of the International Society of Travel Medicine had a major new malaria drug to discuss, Malarone.
