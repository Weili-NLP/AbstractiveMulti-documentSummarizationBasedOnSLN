 The Clinton administration moved forcefully Monday to end the drama over Elian Gonzalez as officials took steps to take custody of the 6-year-old boy from his relatives in Miami as early as Thursday and return him to his father in Cuba.
 The relatives of Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old Cuban boy at the center of an international custody battle, decided Tuesday night to turn the boy over to his father on Wednesday at a meeting here, government officials said on Tuesday night.
In Miami, Elian's great uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, was given temporary custody of the boy and moved him into his Little Havana home.
About 11 p.m., officials from the powerful Cuban American National Foundation announced that the Miami relatives would travel to Washington Wednesday with Elian for a meeting with the boy's father.
The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta rules for the government and Elian's father, but orders the boy to remain in the United States pending appeal.
Gonzalez said he learned that Elian's father expected the Miami relatives to turn the boy over before their meeting, and the Miami family refused to do that.
