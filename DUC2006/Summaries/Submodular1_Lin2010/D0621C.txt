Charges center around the killing of a mainland Chinese businessman and a Hong Kong resident, armed robberies, smuggling explosives into Hong Kong, and the kidnapping of the two Hong Kong businessmen for more than 1.6 billion Hong Kong dollars U.S. dlrs 205 million in ransom.
China's Xinhua news agency said police working with Hong Kong authorities had arrested 18 members of the gang in southern Guangdong province, which is adjacent to Hong Kong.
The arrests are the latest in a series by Chinese and Hong Kong police to crack down on criminal activities related to 43-year-old Hong Kong gang boss Cheung Tze-keung, alias Big Spender.
 A police chief of a southern Chinese city where a reputed Hong Kong crime boss is on trial has stepped up security following assassination threats by gang members, Hong Kong newspapers reported Saturday.
Of the gang members, 18 were Hong Kong residents and 14 were from mainland China, Zhang said.
The newspaper quoted Cheung as saying during his trial in China that had I not been arrested ... there would have been no way that any of Hong Kong's top 10 tycoons could be spared from the gang's kidnapping spree.
Ordinarily, Hong Kong police ask for the return of a Hong Kong citizen who commits crimes in Hong Kong but is arrested in Guangdong.
Local officials contend that the violence has been exaggerated by the Hong Kong news media and that the gangs originally came from Hong Kong and Guangdong Province in the Chinese mainland.
