The new rules require developers to obtain federal permits for any construction projects, including individual homes, on wetlands.
The administration, however, puts modest resources into the two agencies charged with protecting wetlands that exist : the Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency, which together share responsibility for enforcing the federal Clean Water Act that governs wetland development.
Last year, the Corps ordered 47,000 acres of new wetlands, which is more than the 31,000 acres they allowed to be damaged.
The EPA has no say in the final decision on wetlands rules by the corps, but has indicated that the wetlands around the reservoirs deserve special protection.
But the National Association of Home Builders argues that wetland mitigation by developers actually restored more wetlands than were lost under the nationwide permit system.
The State Environmental Protection Administration says that all water conservation projects, and agriculture and forestry development along China's major rivers must be assessed in accordance with environmental protection standards, and that no projects will be allowed if they pose a threat to the environment.
The city's new position echoes the views of Republican officials from rural communities around the reservoirs and pits city officials against private environmental groups and the federal Environmental Protection Agency, which say that special restrictions are needed because wetlands help to purify the city's water.
Critical habitat designation affects developers who need federal usually from the Army Corps of Engineers for their projects.
