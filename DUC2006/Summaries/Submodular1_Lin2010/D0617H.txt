 Investigators from the United States and Egypt will review part of the flight control system in the tail of Boeing's 767 airplane as part of the investigation into the crash of EgyptAir Flight 990, the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board said Friday.
The EgyptAir flight crashed into the Atlantic Ocean shortly after taking off from the New York International Airport on October 31, 1999, on its way to Cairo, killing 217 people on board.
The plane's flight data recorder, one of the two Black Boxes, was retrieved early Tuesday and now is under analysis by experts of U.S. National Transportation Safety Board NTSB in Washington.

 U.S. investigators on Wednesday are continuing the search for the cockpit voice recorder from the ocean depths where the Boeing 767-300 on EgyptAir Flight 990 crashed October 31.
All 217 people on board died in the EgyptAir flight crash.
Also, information from the flight data recorder released early in the investigation showed the plane's autopilot was switched off before it was put into a steep dive.
Until Wednesday, the only information about what happened to EgyptAir Flight 990 had come from an analysis of radar data by the NTSB and the Air Force.
 The Federal Bureau of Investigation FBI of the United States is taking over the investigation of the crash of EgyptAir 990 from the National Transportation Safety Board NTSB, officials said Tuesday.
