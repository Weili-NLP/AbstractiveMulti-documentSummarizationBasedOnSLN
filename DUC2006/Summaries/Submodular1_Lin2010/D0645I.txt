The report, issued by Andrew Cuomo, the U.S. secretary of housing and urban development, said that 5.4 million low-income families pay more than half their incomes for housing or live in dilapidated units, an increase of 12 percent since the economic expansion began in 1991.
Some property owners are dropping out of federal affordable housing subsidy programs in which low-income people pay about 30 percent of their income as rent.
About the only housing program that seems to win new money from Congress is the development of prisons, said Dunlap, noting that Congress has not approved new housing assistance vouchers for low-income families since 1995 when Republicans took over Congress and cut additional housing assistance vouchers from the federal budget.
One would create about 15,000 new Section 8 housing vouchers, which are federal rent subsidies for low-income tenants.
The legislation is also expected to give housing authorities greater flexibility in setting rents on the nation's 1.2 million public housing units, authorize mayors in some cities to take over poorly run housing authorities and allow low-income people to use federal housing vouchers to help pay the costs of buying a house.
We have more people in need of affordable housing than ever before.
The bill is also expected to include a provision sought by New York City that would let housing authorities set aside more units for higher income families provided they exceeded federal requirements for giving housing vouchers to the very poor.
