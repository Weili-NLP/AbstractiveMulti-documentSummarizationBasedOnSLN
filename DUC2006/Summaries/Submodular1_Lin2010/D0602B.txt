The fact is that at least 23 Chinese athletes, mostly women, have tested positive for steroids since 1990.
According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, up to 13 percent of all high school athletes use anabolic steroids and 40 percent of those athletes believe the illegal drug is not harmful.
 Two positive doping tests were announced on Wednesday, just two days before the opening of the Sydney Olympic Games.
You can look at the tests, and you may know the athlete is on steroids, but there's nothing you can do about it.
 Two medical experts testifying Wednesday in the doping trial of a former East German sports doctor said the female swimmers they examined showed health damage linked to performance-enhancing drugs, including liver damage and excessive facial hair.
Twelve athletes tested positive for banned substances during those games.
Creatine currently is the supplement of choice for body building, primarily because it is not an anabolic steroid and because so many athletes endorse its use.
He admitted in court last month that he administered anabolic steroids to athletes, but insisted the doses were too small to cause physical harm and that no one showed ill effects.
But because the test can not distinguish naturally produced testosterone from ingested testosterone, even a high ratio is no guarantee an athlete has taken testosterone or androstenedione, the latter used by Mark McGwire and legal in baseball but banned by the IAAF.
