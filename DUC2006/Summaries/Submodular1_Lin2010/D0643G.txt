La Nina and El Nino form the opposite ends of the same climatic cycle, with El Nino fueled by unusually warm water in the eastern Pacific and La Nina driven by cold.
El Nino is the name given to the unusual warming of waters in the Pacific Ocean that affects global wind and temperature patterns.
The change in the weather was, of course, the work of El Nino.
 Weather satellite data that detect warming in the Indian Ocean and the early signs of an El Nino in the Pacific may also give an early warning about an outbreak of Rift Valley Fever in Africa, according to a study by researchers.
El Nino is a periodic warming of the water in the eastern Pacific Ocean, which shifts weather patterns arriving from that area and can affect the climate worldwide.
It is blamed for flooding and heavy snow in the West, abnormally warm weather in the East and extreme weather from South America to Asia.
Although La Nina is already affecting rainfall in Southeast Asia, it has n't noticeably influenced North America's weather yet, Leetmaa said Instead, it may be that warm water left over from El Nino is contributing to the formation of more tropical storms than normal in the eastern Pacific.
The scientists worked with a computer model currently used to predict El Nino events.
La Nina refers to the phenomenon of rapidly cooling equatorial waters in the central Pacific.
