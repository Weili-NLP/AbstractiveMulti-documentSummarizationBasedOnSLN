But what kind of man is Putin?
 Communist Party chief Gennady Zyuganov on Tuesday became the first candidate approved for Russia's March 26 presidential election, though polls show him still far behind acting President Vladimir Putin.
 Russian President Boris Yeltsin on Monday announced that he wanted acting Prime Minister Vladimir Putin to succeed him as Russia's next president in next summer elections.
 Russian acting President, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin will not leave Russia for a visit before the presidential election scheduled for March 26, said a top Kremlin official Tuesday.
The acting president has the support of about 60 percent of voters, with Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov in second place with 20 percent, opinion polls say.
 Russia's government will boost pensions by 20 percent as of Feb. 1, acting President Vladimir Putin said Tuesday in an apparent appeal to voters ahead of March presidential elections.
With 96 percent of the vote counted, Russian election officials named Putin, 47, the winner of only the second democratic presidential election in Russia's history with 53 percent.
 Russia's Central Election Commission CEC officially announced Wednesday that Vladimir Putin was elected president in the March 26 balloting by collecting 52.94 percent of the votes.
 Russian President Boris Yeltsin's announcement Friday to resign and name Prime Minister Vladimir Putin as acting president has surprised the nation and many say the move will further boost Putin's chance of winning the presidential race.
