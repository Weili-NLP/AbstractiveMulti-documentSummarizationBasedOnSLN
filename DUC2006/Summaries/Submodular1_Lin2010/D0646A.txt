WHAT IS THE PERJURY CASE AGAINST PRESIDENT CLINTON?
At another point in the Jones deposition, Clinton said : I have never had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky.
 A federal judge Monday found President Clinton in civil contempt of court for lying in a deposition about the nature of his sexual relationship with former White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky.
The lie, according to the Starr report and the House Judiciary Committee, is that Clinton repeatedly denied having a sexual relationship with Lewinsky in the civil case.
On the question of whether he discussed Lewinsky's possible testimony in the Jones case with Lewinsky or Vernon Jordan, White House lawyers argue that Starr and Republicans have pinpointed only the answers that suggest perjury by Clinton.
She was convicted of perjury.
In his deposition in the Jones lawsuit, Clinton denied he had engaged in a sexual affair, a sexual relationship or sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky.
While the House rejected an impeachment article that said Clinton lied in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case, it approved an article that said Clinton lied about many of the same facts before the federal grand jury.
 The first two impeachment articles that the House will debate Thursday charge President Clinton with perjury in the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal.
Clinton's defense, according to his lawyers, is that the definition of sexual relations used in the Jones case did not include oral sex.
