The administration's budget plan shows that Clinton would not use any of the Social Security surplus for other programs.
Clinton's plan includes $ 34 billion in tax cuts over five years, $ 39 billion in increased spending over the current fiscal year and projects a record $ 117 billion surplus.
Over the next five years, the measure would set aside at least $ 150 billion for tax cuts and the entire $ 1 trillion in projected Social Security surpluses for debt reduction, Republicans said.
 Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on Wednesday trashed President Clinton's plan to invest government funds in the stock market in order to produce more revenue for the Social Security retirement system.
The surplus is not the government's money.
Clinton wants to take $ 374 billion over 10 years from the non-Social Security surplus for additional debt reduction, although his plan would in essence just leave the government owing the money to the Medicare system rather than to the public.
Greenspan also used his appearance to reiterate his position that the federal budget surplus should be used to reduce the national debt rather than for tax cuts or new spending.
The Congressional Budget Office projects that the total federal budget surplus over the next 10 years will be $ 2.9 trillion.
On taxes, Summers said Clinton would support a $ 250 billion cut.
 U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan emphatically cautioned lawmakers Wednesday against spending projected federal budget surpluses that he said may not materialize.
