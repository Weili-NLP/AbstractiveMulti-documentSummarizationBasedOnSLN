Barnes & Noble's sales account for about 14 percent of the consumer book market.
In 1997, about 25 percent of adult book purchases were made at Barnes & Noble and other chains while just over 17 percent were made at independent stores.
Barnes & Noble has about 14 percent of the retail book market.
As Richard Howorth, owner of Square Books in Oxford and president of the American Booksellers Association says, In 1991, when Barnes & Noble and Borders began to expand, there were 5,200 members of the ABA.
For the first time that electronic commerce was measured as a category, online stores captured 2 percent of the book market while independent booksellers continued to lose share, which declined less than one percentage point, to 16.6 percent.
The unit sales of adult trade books are projected to grow more an indication that online sales are not expected to increase the market for popular books.
Research from the American Booksellers Association shows, Hoynes says, that the typical customer of an independent bookstore buys an average of 20 books a year, but only eight of those at an independent store.
Barnes & Noble, the nation's largest bookstore chain, intends to sell 20 percent of the online venture, Barnesandnoble.com, which generated $ 14 million in sales last year in contrast to Amazon's $ 147.8 million.
The request to the state agency was made by the Northern California Independent Booksellers Association and the American Booksellers Association.
