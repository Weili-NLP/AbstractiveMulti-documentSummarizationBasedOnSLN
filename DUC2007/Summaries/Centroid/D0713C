 Hoping to curb the nuclear arms race in South Asia, the Security Council considered a Japanese resolution urging India and Pakistan to halt nuclear weapons programs and denying nuclear status to the two rivals.
Top diplomats from the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France, at an emergency meeting to deal with the South Asian arms race, also promised to assist in cooling tension between India and Pakistan and called upon them to avoid threatening military movements, cross-border violations or other provocative acts.
The ministers condemned these tests, expressed their deep concern about the danger to peace and stability in the region, and pledged to cooperate closely in urgent efforts to prevent a nuclear and missile arms race in the subcontinent, the powers stated in a joint communique.
Japan finds the nuclear tests totally unacceptable as they pose a grave challenge to the international non-proliferation regime and seriously undermines stability in South Asia, Yukata Takeyama, chairman of Japan's Atomic Energy Commission, told delegates at the International Atomic Energy Agency conference.
Riyadh is looking forward to seeing the Middle East region free of all kinds of mass destruction weapons, said Saudi Crown Prince and Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz during a weekly cabinet session he chaired in the country's western city of Jeddah.
