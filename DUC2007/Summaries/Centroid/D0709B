 Angelina Jolie, the disruptive mental patient in Girl, Interrupted, won the Academy Award for best supporting actress Sunday night, a generation after her father took home an Oscar.
 Gwyneth Paltrow of Shakespeare In Love and Michael Caine were honored Sunday for motion picture acting, and Michael J. Fox was a funny but poignant winner for TV comedy actor at the Golden Globes.
But it does boast two of this year's Oscar nominees in starring Denzel Washington, who is up in the best actor category for his role of wrongly convicted boxer Rubin Carter in Hurricane, and Angelina Jolie, who received the best supporting actress nod for her role as the mentally disturbed teen, Lisa, in Girl, Interrupted.
 The director and producer of the serial-killer thriller The Bone Collector, due out Friday, readily admit Universal Studios executives did n't want Angelina Jolie.
 Shakespeare in Love led movie nominees for the 5th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards, and NYPD Blue edged ahead of the pack in television nominations announced Tuesday.
 When a stunning Angelina Jolie announced a few minutes after winning a Golden Globe that she would take a plunge, gown and all, in the hotel swimming pool, she must have seemed insane to anyone who had just watched her wiggle to the stage to claim her award for her part in Gia, an HBO movie.
