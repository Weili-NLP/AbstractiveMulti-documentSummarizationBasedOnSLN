 An old pickup truck federal investigators believe was stolen almost two weeks ago by Birmingham bomb suspect Eric Robert Rudolph was driven a few dozen miles over four days before it was abandoned in a remote Nantahala camp site, the head of the Southeast Bomb Task Force said Wednesday.
 Despite large law enforcement numbers, Rudolph still eludesBy Jennifer Brett C. 1998 Cox News Service More than 200 state, local and federal agents continued the search in the mountains of western North Carolina for Eric Robert Rudolph Sunday, but the 31-year-old suspect in the fatal Jan. 29 bombing of a Birmingham abortion clinic continued to elude his trackers.
 Federal officials said on Monday that there was no evidence linking Eric Robert Rudolph, the North Carolina fugitive charged in four Southern bombings, to an explosion outside an abortion clinic in Asheville, N.C., on Saturday morning.
 After five and a half months in hiding, the man wanted for the fatal bombing of an Alabama abortion clinic emerged from the woods of western North Carolina last week, took a large amount of food and a pickup truck from a residence, then abandoned the truck and vanished once more, federal authorities said on Tuesday.
They believe Rudolph watched the house of 71-year-old George Nordmann for several days before approaching the health food store owner July 7.
