 More than two years after the federal government's first effort to define and regulate organic food failed to win public approval, the Department of Agriculture is announcing much tougher rules that prohibit the use of genetically modified ingredients in products carrying the organic label.
 WASHINGTON The Department of Agriculture announced Thursday that it would allow farmers who raise meat and poultry without pesticide-treated feed, growth hormones or antibiotics to label their meat certified organic.
Feeding a pet those processed foods all the time is like giving your kid Trix versus Grape Nuts or Cheerios, says Amy Shapiro, owner of two natural pet stores, the eight-year-old Barking Zoo in Chelsea and the newly opened Another Barking Zoo in Tribeca.
 In a reversal, the government is planning to issue rules prohibiting the label organic for any food that is irradiated, genetically engineered or treated with antibiotics, a top agriculture official told farmers Thursday.
 Farmers doubled the nation's organic crop acreage in the 1990s, and production of organic eggs and milk increased even more to meet rising consumer demand, the government says.
The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court by Greenpeace International, the Center for Food Safety and the International Federation of Organic Agricultural Movements charges the Environmental Protection Agency with wanton destruction of Bt, which it calls the world's most important biological pesticide.
