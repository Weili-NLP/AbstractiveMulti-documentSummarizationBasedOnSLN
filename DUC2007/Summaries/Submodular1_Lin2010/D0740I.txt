Pilots Brian Jones of England and Bertrand Piccard of Switzerland have flown further than any balloonist before, traveling more than 21,625 miles after leaving the Swiss Alps on March 1.
It will be Piccard's third attempt to become the first to pilot a balloon around the world nonstop.
 The Swiss and British balloonists aiming to be the first to circle the world nonstop floated over the Pacific Ocean Thursday after making it across China, their Geneva control center said.
The first two, Bertrand Piccard of Switzerland and Brian Jones of Britain, completed a 20-day trip together last March, ending in the Egyptian desert.
If the team makes it to North Africa, it will have traveled more than 26,000 miles around the world and Piccard and Jones will have conquered one of the last great challenges facing aviators.
With a second balloon team moving steadily along behind them, the British pair hope to pick up speed on the crossing to North America and in about two weeks time to become the first balloonists to fly nonstop around the world.
The adventurers, Bertrand Piccard of Switzerland and Brian Jones of England, steered their balloon over the Pacific Ocean toward Hawaii and California or Mexico, their control center said.
Jones and Piccard have traveled more than 20,500 miles since lifting off from the Swiss Alps on March 1.
On March 7, two British balloonists abandoned their attempt because of bad weather, landing in the Pacific near Japan.
