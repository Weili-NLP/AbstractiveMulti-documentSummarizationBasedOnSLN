 Two Israelis who were arrested in Cyprus last week on suspicion of spying are agents of the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad, an Israeli newspaper said Thursday.
The two Israelis that were arrested in Cyprus did n't act against Cyprus and did n't act on Turkey's behalf, the statement said.
 The two Israelis arrested in Cyprus on suspicion of spying were not working for Israel, the Cypriot government said Sunday.
 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has admitted that the two Israelis arrested in Cyprus on suspicion of espionage against Cyprus are Mossad agents, Cyprus News Agency CNA reported Thursday.
Cypriot police had said they suspected the Israelis were spying on behalf of Turkey, which invaded and occupied the northern third of Cyprus in 1974.
Cypriot police officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Haaretz the two men were believed to be spying on behalf of Turkey, a military ally of Israel.
A statement released this week by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office was interpreted by Israeli media as a confirmation that two worked for Israel's Mossad.
Police on the island said the two were spying on behalf of Turkey, which has a defense pact with Israel.
The two deny they are spies, but their arrest soured relations between Cyprus and Israel and came only days after President Ezer Weizman ended the first ever official visit to the island by an Israeli head of state.
