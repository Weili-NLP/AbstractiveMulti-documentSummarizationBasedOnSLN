On 14 February 1989, late Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini issued a religious edict, pronouncing a sentence of death on British author Salman Rushdie and his publishers in protest against the publication of Rushdie's novel The Satanic Verses, and exhorting all Moslems to carry out the sentence.
On Thursday, Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi distanced his government from a dlrs 2.5 million reward for Rushdie's death.
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued the fatwa, or religious edict, on Rushdie in 1989, claiming his book The Satanic Verses blasphemed Islam.
 An Iranian foundation has added dlrs 300,000 to the reward for Salman Rushdie's death, just weeks after the Iranian government tried to distance itself from the bounty.
 The British government said Wednesday that it would continue to press Iran to lift the death sentence against the author Salman Rushdie when its foreign secretary, Robin Cook, meets the Iranian foreign minister in New York on Thursday.
Mostafa Mirsalim, Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance, said at a press conference held last week that Iran will take the case of insulting religious sanctities like the Rushdie affair to the United Nations.
However, the Iranian culture minister did not say whether Iran intends to drop late religious leader Ayatollah Khomeini's fatwa against Salman Rushdie.
 Iran announced here today that it drops the death sentence on Salman Rushdie, a British writer accused of defaming Islam in his novel, under tremendous pressure from European countries.
