Even wolves are having problems.
A wolf would need more.
 Someone has shot dead yet another endangered Mexican gray wolf in eastern Arizona, the fifth one killed since the wolves were brought back to the wild this year, federal officials said Tuesday.
If the restoration program survives the court challenge, the Northern Rockies wolf population can be removed from protection under the Endangered Species Act when there have been at least 100 wolves and 10 packs in each of the three recovery areas.
In 1971, wolves were placed on the endangered species list.
Under the program, Canadian gray wolves were relocated in Yellowstone and central Idaho and considered an experimental and nonessential wolf population, which means they lost much of the protection they would otherwise have under the Endangered Species Act.
One of the wolves was out before the biologists could retreat from the pen, said Dave Parsons, head of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Mexican gray wolf recovery program, The wolves are native to Arizona, New Mexico and northern Mexico.
The Interior Department has listed gray wolves as an endangered species through most of the lower 48 states since 1973, when the Endangered Species Act was passed.
The wolves would be removed from all Endangered Species protection in all or part of 30 states where wolf introduction is unlikely.
The reintroduction of wolves in Yellowstone has resulted in more than 300 wolves in Wyoming, Idaho and Montana.
