According to the Oslo accords, a permanent peace agreement should be signed between the Palestinians and Israel by the date.
 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat not to declare an independent Palestinian State on May 4 this year.
 President of Palestinian National Authority PNA Yasser Arafat today Condemned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's policies on peace process and sanctions against the Palestinians.
Under the Oslo accords, Israel should transfer all remaining West Bank territories to Palestinian control during the third redeployment.
 A senior Palestinian National Authority PNA official Thursday urged Israel to implement the Oslo accords and the Hebron agreement in a bid to move the Mideast peace process forward.
Following months of secret talks held in Oslo, the Israeli and Palestinian negotiators reached agreement on August 20 of 1993 on principles of Palestinian self-rule, widely-known later as the Oslo Accords which started the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that the interim deal he struck with the Palestinians was unlike the Oslo Accords, which he said were not good agreements.
It is still unclear how many of the West Bank territories would be included in the third withdrawal, despite press reports that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is ready to hand over 90 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians in a final peace agreement.
Moreover, the two sides also have to decide on the last Israeli troop redeployment in the West Bank under the Oslo accords signed in 1993.
