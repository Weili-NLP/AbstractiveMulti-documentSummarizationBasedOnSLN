According to a Turkish Foreign Ministry statement, the European Union has taken up, during Monday's meeting, the situation between Turkey and Greece.
 Turkey said Wednesday it wants the European Union to make it a formal candidate for membership at its summit later this week.
 Turkey today welcomed the European Union's attitude toward its dispute with Greece and urged the EU to release financial assistance immediately despite Greek efforts to block it.
The special aid is part of the agreement between the European Union EU and Turkey on the establishment of a customs union between the two sides.
Greece has said that it supports Turkey's European vocation but Ankara must improve both its human rights record and its relations with Athens.
 Turkey's foreign minister on Thursday said the European Union's definition of Turkey as a candidate for membership will pave the way to improved relations between Brussels and Ankara.
We strongly believe that the European Union should allow the possibility of Turkish membership in the future.
 Greece threatened Thursday to react strongly if the European Commission's decision to release a 155 million-dollar package of economic aid to Turkey was approved by the European Union EU Council of Ministers.
 Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou said Friday that his country was keen to see neighboring Turkey become a candidate for European Union EU membership.
 The European Parliament today voted to block a 53 million ECU 70 million U.S. dollars special aid package to Turkey because of what it called a deterioration in the human rights situation in the country.
