The Gingriches divorce will be Newt Gingrich's second, and Marianne Gingrich's first.
 The estranged wife of former U.S. House speaker Newt Gingrich wants a Cobb County, Ga., judge to freeze the couple's assets until their divorce is final.
Gingrich filed for divorce July 29 from Marianne Gingrich.
In a motion filed in Cobb County Superior Court, Gingrich asked a judge to give his wife Marianne 14 days to transfer the money to a joint account the couple agreed to set up last month until their divorce is final.
Newt Gingrich's attorney, Randy Evans, says Marianne Gingrich has refused to even discuss a settlement until she questions Bisek.
Marianne Gingrich also wants to depose Callista Bisek, a congressional aide with whom the former U.S. House speaker has a relationship.
Bisek has asked a Washington judge to block Marianne Gingrich's subpoena asking her to answer questions about her relationship with the former speaker.
Newt Gingrich's attorneys have said he and Marianne were separated when the relationship with Bisek began.
The deposition would come two days before he and estranged wife Marianne Gingrich are to make their first court appearance together since the former speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives filed for divorce in July.
 The estranged wife of former U.S. House speaker Newt Gingrich wants a Cobb County, Ga., judge to freeze the couple's assets until their divorce is final.
The agreement gives Mrs. Gingrich the couple's house in Marietta, Ga., and Gingrich their Washington apartment.
