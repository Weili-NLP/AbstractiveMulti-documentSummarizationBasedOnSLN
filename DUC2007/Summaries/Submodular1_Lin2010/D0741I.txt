He committed suicide hours after a killing rampage in Atlanta left 12 people dead : nine people in two trading offices, plus his two children and his second wife.
Barton, a chemist and securities day trader, wrote in his letter that he killed his current wife, Leigh Ann, on Tuesday night and his two children, 11-year-old Matthew and 8-year-old Mychelle, on Wednesday night.
In a note left for authorities, Barton said he killed Leigh Ann on Tuesday and placed her body in a closet of her Stockbridge apartment.
But the securities firm where Barton began his shooting rampage disclosed Friday that he had lost $ 105,000 on 15 trading days the day he went home and killed his wife.
Four people were killed in that office.
Police say they have been unable to determine what motivated Barton to kill his wife, Leigh Ann, on Tuesday, his children, Matthew and Mychelle, on Wednesday, and nine people in two Atlanta office buildings on Thursday before taking his own life.
Leigh Ann Barton took them in.
Barton, a former chemist who reportedly lost as much as $ 450,000 while trading at All-Tech and Momentum Securities in the last year, killed nine people and wounded 13 others at the two companies Atlanta offices on July 29.
Delawalla and eight other people were shot to death at All-Tech and Momentum Securities, another day trading firm where Barton was a regular.
