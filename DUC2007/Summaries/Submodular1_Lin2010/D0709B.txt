 Angelina Jolie, the disruptive mental patient in Girl, Interrupted, won the Academy Award for best supporting actress Sunday night, a generation after her father took home an Oscar.
 Angelina Jolie's win for best supporting actress for her role in Girl, Interrupted came 21 years after father Jon Voight was awarded best actor for Coming Home.
I need to learn to need other people, Jolie says.
Angelina Jolie won best actress in a miniseries or TV movie for Gia, which also earned Faye Dunaway an award for supporting actress in a series, miniseries or TV movie.
Jolie, who turned 25 on Sunday, already has three Golden Globes, for the title role in the HBO movie Gia, about a supermodel who died of AIDS ; for the TV movie George Wallace ; and for last year's theatrical film Girl, Interrupted.
Jolie, the daughter of actor Jon Voight, won an Oscar this year for her role as a hospitalized sociopath in Girl, Interrupted.
Both already picked up Golden Globe Awards earlier in the year, and Jolie won a Screen Actors Guild statuette on Sunday.
After that movie, Jolie said, she needed something down to earth.
This is the fifth marriage for Thornton and the second for Jolie.
But Washington, a former best supporting actor Oscar winner, can do a lot with a little.
