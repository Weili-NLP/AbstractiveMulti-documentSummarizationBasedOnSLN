Napster's software allows music fans to easily share their MP3 music files through the Internet.
Computer users who download the Napster software can then use the Napster site to list the music stored on their computers.
Until last week, when Metallica and the rapper Dr. Dre sued Napster for copyright infringement, the battle had been waged primarily by the music companies trade group, the Recording Industry Association of America.
 The heavy metal band Metallica on Wednesday dropped legal action against Yale University after the school agreed to block access from their computer network to an Internet site that allows people to trade copyrighted music.
