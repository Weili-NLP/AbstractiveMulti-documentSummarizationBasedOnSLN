 A small plane carrying John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister disappeared late Friday off the Massachusetts coast, and by Saturday afternoon the authorities had recovered debris from the airplane off Martha's Vineyard.
The 38-year-old son of former President Kennedy was reported missing early Saturday on a flight from Essex County Airport in Fairfield, N.J. Also aboard the plane, which Kennedy was piloting, were his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and Lauren Bessette, her elder sister, according to officials and a family spokesman.
But as he headed for the small airport on Martha's Vineyard Friday night, John F. Kennedy Jr. knew where he was going.
Kennedy's single-engine Piper Saratoga crashed as he was flying with his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister Lauren, from Fairfield, N.J., near New York City, to Martha's Vineyard.
On board were Kennedy's wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister Lauren.
 An employee of Martha's Vineyard Airport alerted federal aviation officials that John F. Kennedy Jr.'s plane was unaccounted for nearly four hours before a phone call from a Kennedy family friend early Saturday morning triggered a massive air and sea search.
Kennedy's Saratoga was almost new, the pilot said.
The Kennedy plane took off from the Fairfield airport at 8:30 p.m. EDT Friday and was due to land on Martha's Vineyard at 10:30, according to the Coast Guard.
