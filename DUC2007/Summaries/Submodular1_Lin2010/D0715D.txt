The Ottawa Treaty was signed in December 1997 by 135 countries, 74 of which have ratified it.
 Burkino Faso became the 40th country to ratify an international treaty to ban anti-personnel land mines Wednesday, meaning the treaty will go into effect in six months, the United Nations announced.
The ban on use, production and stockpiling of the anti-personnel weapon has been signed by 127 countries.
 The South African Campaign Against Landmines has called on President Bill Clinton of the United States to sign a treaty banning landmines.
More than 120 countries signed the treaty, known as the Ottawa Convention, in the Canadian capital in December, but it needs to be ratified by 40 countries to take effect.
In a survey completed last April, the International Campaign to Ban Land Mines, which won the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize, reported that governments or rebel groups in at least 13 countries had used mines in the 15 months after the treaty was signed, though before it officially went into force.
Nations that ratify the treaty pledged to destroy all stockpiles of mines within four years and clear away all mines from their territory within 10 years.
A conference on the land mine ban will be held in Ottawa on December 2-4 when those participating countries are expected to sign the treaty.
Canada signed the treaty several months ago and destroyed its last land mine last week.
