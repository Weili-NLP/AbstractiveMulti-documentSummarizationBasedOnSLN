This year Peru's mining companies planned to invest over 350 million U.S. dollars to increase gold production.
 Peru turned out 56.4 tons of gold in 1995, representing an increase of 18 percent over the previous year, the Energy and Mining Ministry said today.
Meilan added that from 1996 to 2000, the total investment in Argentina's mining sector would be around 3.5 billion U.S. dollars, which will help increase gold exports from 32 million to 1.3 billion dollars.
The line is to supply electricity to Brazil, Indian communities in Venezuela and gold mining companies that plan to come to Venezuela to extract some of the largest gold deposits in Latin America.
 Peru's gold output this year is expected to grow by 20.5 percent from last year to 92.6 tons, keeping Peru the eighth biggest gold manufacturing country in the world.
 Peru's mining production is expected to increase by 7 to 8 percent in 1996 if international metal prices are stable, Peruvian mining industry sources said today.
Peru's copper output in 1995 was 480,000 tons and its copper export earned 800 million U.S. dollars.
Peru sold a total of 641.6 million dollars of gold during the first 10 months of the year, compared with 412.2 million dollars in the same period of 1997.
Franco-Nevada is the fifth largest gold company in the world, while Gold Fields ranks second among gold producers in South Africa and is one of the largest in the world.
