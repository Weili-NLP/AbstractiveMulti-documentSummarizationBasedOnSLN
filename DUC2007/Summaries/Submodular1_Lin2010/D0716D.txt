The mine is not in a world heritage listed area nor in a national park and it will cause neither environmental nor cultural damage, Hill said.
 The Australian federal government Thursday rejected a UNESCO report which called for Kakadu National Park in northwest Australia to be placed on the endangered list because of the threat posed by the Jabiluka uranium mine.
An eight-member team from the U.N.'s World Heritage Bureau will visit environmental and Aboriginal cultural sites and speak to interest groups including the company building the mine, Energy Resources of Australia Ltd..
 Police arrested more than 100 protesters Tuesday at Energy Resources of Australia's Jabiluka mine development at Kakadu, a world heritage listed area in the Northern Territory.
Construction begun one week ago at Jabiluka, a uranium mining lease lying within the boundaries of Kakadu National Park, listed by the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization on its World Heritage list of important cultural and environmental sites.
 The Australian government will have until April 15 of next year to try to stop the United Nations from declaring Kakadu National Park endangered because of the Jabiluka uranium mine.
The park is one of a handful of 552 World Heritage sites listed for both its environmental and cultural values.
The World Heritage Committee report found the Jabiluka uranium mine threatened the surrounding Kakadu World Heritage area and raised the prospect of Kakadu being placed on the committee's endangered list.
