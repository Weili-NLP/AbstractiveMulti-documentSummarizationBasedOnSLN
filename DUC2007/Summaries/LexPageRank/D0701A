A who's who of the hate movement visited the place over the years, including William Pierce, author of a book about a race war called The Turner Diaries that allegedly inspired Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh ; former Texas Klan leader Louis Beam ; and Tom Metzger of the White Aryan Resistance, who lost his house and possessions to a SPLC lawsuit.
 Issuing a verdict that civil rights organizations hope will bankrupt one of the nation's largest white-supremacist groups and limit its ability to preach hate, a state jury in northern Idaho Thursday ordered leaders of the Aryan Nations to pay more than $ 6 million to the victims of an attack two years ago by men who were serving as security guards at the group's compound near here.
Buford R. Furrow Jr., a former Aryan Nations security guard charged with killing a Los Angeles postal worker and wounding five in an attack on a Jewish day-care center, is the latest Butler disciple to make news for racist violence.
And a new breed of prosecutors and investigators, feeling an urgency as many witnesses and defendants in the cases grow old, is realizing the important role that resolving these cases can play in the South's efforts to move beyond its past of racial hate and terrorism.
People who study hate groups consider Butler a godfather of the white supremacist movement.
