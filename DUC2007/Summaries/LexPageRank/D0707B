Turkey, already a member country of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization NATO, signed an agreement on Customs Union with the EU in January 1996 and has been seeking an EU membership.
She said her country would make new efforts toward full EU membership.
The decisive factors are not the cultural ones, but the human rights situation, the conflict with the Kurds, the country's economic problems and its relations with Greece, said Kinkel at a conference on the subject of Islam and Europe in Berlin.
The relations between Turkey and EU have been soured after EU leaders decided last December not to accept Turkey as an official new member candidate, though they did not rule out its candidacy in the future.
Turkey suspended its dialogue with the EU last year after the union decided not to begin membership talks with Ankara because of Turkey's shaky human rights record and territorial disputes with Greece.
Turkey submitted its formal application for the EU membership in 1987, but so far the goal has not been achieved due to its various differences with the EU, such as on human rights, economic problems as well as the Cyprus issue.
The 15-nation EU rejected a membership of Turkey last week.
Turkish authorities are frequently accused of systematically violating human rights, especially in the southeast where Kurdish rebels have been fighting for autonomy since 1984.
