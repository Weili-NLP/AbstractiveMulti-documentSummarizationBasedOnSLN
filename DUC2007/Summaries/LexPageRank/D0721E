In the aftermath of the Wyoming killing, the same groups that worked overtime to stigmatize gay people have mounted a furious propaganda defense to assert that their words and ads demeaning gay people have nothing to do with any anti-gay crimes.
 Aaron J. McKinney killed a gay student at the University of Wyoming last year in a five-minute emotional rage because the student, Matthew Shepard, had made sexual advances that reminded him of homosexual abuse he had suffered as a child, McKinney's lawyer told a jury on Monday as his murder trial began here.
More than 4,000 people attended the march, which was billed as a political funeral to protest the killing of Matthew Shepard, 21, who died on Oct. 12 after being beaten and lashed to a fence in Wyoming in what the authorities called a bias-related crime.
As a bartender at the Fireside Lounge in Laramie, Wyo., Galloway was one of the last people to see Matthew Shepard alive 17 months ago before two local roofers lured him into a truck, beat him, robbed him and left him for dead on a wooden fence on the outskirts all because Shepard, a 21-year-old student at the University of Wyoming, was gay.
McKinney's attorney, Dion Custis, told reporters Henderson fabricated the story to save himself from the death penalty.
