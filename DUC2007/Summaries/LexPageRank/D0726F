With impeachment behind Clinton, Gore is now free to confront his lone declared Democratic challenger, former Sen.

And while he did not mention Bush by name, he noted that some Republican candidates stand and pretend to support public education while at the same time supporting this risky tax scheme that would devastate public education in this country.
