All because of Mark Barton.
He committed suicide hours after a killing rampage in Atlanta left 12 people dead : nine people in two trading offices, plus his two children and his second wife.
Police say they have been unable to determine what motivated Barton to kill his wife, Leigh Ann, on Tuesday, his children, Matthew and Mychelle, on Wednesday, and nine people in two Atlanta office buildings on Thursday before taking his own life.
By that time, police had learned that Barton used a hammer to kill his estranged wife in her Stockbridge apartment on July 27 and to take the lives of their children Matthew, 11, and Mychelle, 8, the day before he packed his van with four pistols and set out for Buckhead.
Mark O. Barton left the computer-generated note in the living room of his family's apartment in suburban Stockbridge, describing how he killed his wife and two children by hitting them in the head with a hammer Tuesday and Wednesday, said Jimmy Mercer, police chief in Henry County, where Stockbridge is located.
Barton, a chemist and securities day trader, wrote in his letter that he killed his current wife, Leigh Ann, on Tuesday night and his two children, 11-year-old Matthew and 8-year-old Mychelle, on Wednesday night.
