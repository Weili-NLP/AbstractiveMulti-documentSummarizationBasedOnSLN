Justice John Paul Stevens wrote the majority opinion for a court divided 6-to-3 in the line item veto case Clinton vs. City of New Article I, Section 7 of the U.S. Constitution : Every bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it becomes a law, be presented to the president of the United States ; if he approves he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, with objections to that House in which it shall have originated ... Returning a bill is a veto.
If there is to be a new procedure in which the President will play a different role in determining the final text of what may become a law, such change must come not by legislation but through the amendment procedures set forth in Article V of the Constitution ... EXCERPTS FROM DISSENTS FOLLOW IN 2nd TAKE nn FROM THE DISSENT By Justice Scalia Insofar as the degree of political, law-making power conferred upon the Executive is concerned, there is not a dime's worth of difference between Congress authorizing the President to CANCEL a spending item, and Congress authorizing money to be spent on a particular item at the President's discretion.
Clinton is the first president to have line-item veto authority.
But the court said Thursday that such line-item vetoes were unconstitutional.
