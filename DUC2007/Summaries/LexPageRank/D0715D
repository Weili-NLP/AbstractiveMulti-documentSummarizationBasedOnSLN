 Burkino Faso became the 40th country to ratify an international treaty to ban anti-personnel land mines Wednesday, meaning the treaty will go into effect in six months, the United Nations announced.
The report, produced by the Nobel laureate International Campaign to Ban Landmines, will be presented next week to a Geneva meeting of countries that have ratified a 1997 treaty outlawing the weapons.
Though the international organization admitted that Angola does not produce or export land mines, it said they have found, in Angola, about 60 kinds of anti-personnel land mines imported from over 10 countries.
Despite a treaty signed by 135 countries to ban their use, production and stockpiling, anti-personnel land mines appear to be as popular as ever in fighting wars these days.
With a land mine treaty ratified in record time, they want every nation to sign it and the millions of land mines that continue to kill, maim and sow terror around the world removed.
The land mine campaign brought together governments, grassroots organizations, the United Nations, big business, the late Princess Diana, and ordinary citizens in a unique partnership which Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy said is becoming a new model for action on a range of international humanitarian issues including curbing small arms.
