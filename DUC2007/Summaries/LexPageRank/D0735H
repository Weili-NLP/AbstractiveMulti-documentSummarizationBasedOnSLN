Even wolves are having problems.
 Someone has shot dead yet another endangered Mexican gray wolf in eastern Arizona, the fifth one killed since the wolves were brought back to the wild this year, federal officials said Tuesday.
A wolf would need more.
The wolves would be removed from all Endangered Species protection in all or part of 30 states where wolf introduction is unlikely.
Their findings, not yet published, suggest that the timber wolf of eastern Canada and formerly of the eastern United States, long considered a subspecies of gray wolf, is in fact a separate species and may be more closely related to the red wolf than the gray.
The reintroduction of wolves in Yellowstone has resulted in more than 300 wolves in Wyoming, Idaho and Montana.
Cattle ranching, Suckling said, should be phased out in all three areas ; the government should close unneeded roads in the Apache and Gila national forests, and provide full wilderness status, which would ban mechanized vehicles, to the Blue range ; and ranchers should drop their federal lawsuit challenging the wolf releases.
 Four endangered Mexican gray wolves have been freed to roam the Apache National Forest, the first of their breed released this year in efforts to restore the animals in their natural habitat.
