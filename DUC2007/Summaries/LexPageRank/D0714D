Napster does n't do anything.
The RIAA and the rock band Metallica have both sued Napster, alleging the company's software allows computer users to trade copyrighted music online without permission.
 The heavy metal band Metallica on Wednesday dropped legal action against Yale University after the school agreed to block access from their computer network to an Internet site that allows people to trade copyrighted music.
Napster, a company in San Mateo, Calif., that operates an online service, has cited those exemptions as a defense against lawsuits from major record companies, the heavy metal band Metallica and the rap artist Dr. Dre, who have accused it of engaging in vicarious copyright infringement.
The target is Napster, the software company that allows computer users to swap music files with other users for free, whether the music is by unknown bands or and this issue has ignited a firestorm of debate among musicians, record labels, and increasingly, the courts, which have been asked to rule on copyright questions regarding online piracy.
The copyright dispute has drawn intense lobbying in Washington from the software industry, recording companies, Hollywood studios and even book publishers as Internet distribution undermines ownership of intellectual property across the spectrum of copyrighted material.
Napster chief executive Hank Barry countered that the Web site's 20 million users have a right to share music under copyright law.
