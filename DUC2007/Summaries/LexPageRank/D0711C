U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson had planned to issue his final ruling, widely expected to call for a breakup of the company, Thursday or Friday.
U.S. District Judge Dee Benson on Thursday postponed the trial until Jan. 17 after Microsoft said its key attorneys were enmeshed in the federal antitrust action against Microsoft in Washington, D.C. Meanwhile, Microsoft has launched a new attack, arguing Caldera has not uncovered evidence to support its claims that Microsoft has used illegal marketing and licensing tactics.
It was on that issue that the federal appeals court in Washington overruled Jackson in an earlier phase of the company's battle with the government.
 A Harvard legal scholar told the judge in the Microsoft antitrust case Tuesday that the company's decision to bundle its Web browser into the Windows operating system had obvious benefits to computer programmers and consumers.
The risks for Jackson in the ruling, the legal experts said, included his decision to deny Microsoft new hearings on whether to break up the company or impose some lesser remedy after he had decided it abused its monopoly power.
 Ebullient over their legal victory against Microsoft, Justice Department antitrust officials said Monday that they would examine possible remedies to put an end what a federal judge described as the company's monopolistic practices.
