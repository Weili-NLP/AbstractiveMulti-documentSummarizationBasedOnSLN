Near exhaustion on the 20th day in their shiny red capsule hanging from a massive silver balloon, Brian Jones of Britain and Bertrand Piccard of Switzerland faced the decision of crossing the finish line and touching down soon after, probably in Mali, or riding the jet stream hundreds of miles farther to a more dramatic landing near the pyramids in Egypt.
With a second balloon team moving steadily along behind them, the British pair hope to pick up speed on the crossing to North America and in about two weeks time to become the first balloonists to fly nonstop around the world.
 A Swiss, Belgium and British team aiming to set a round-the-world ballooning record have delayed their start by 24 hours to Friday to take advantage of more favourable winds, a spokesman said on Wednesday.
In February the Swiss pilot, along with British flight engineer Andy Elson and Belgian pilot Wim Verstraeten, broke the record for the longest time spent in the air by a balloon, landing in Myanmar, also Burma, after a flight lasting 9 days, 17 hours and 55 minutes.
Balloonists Bertrand Piccard and Brian Jones, who made their journey over 19 days in March, beamed as museum officials showed off the neon orange passenger compartment of their Breitling Orbiter 3 balloon.
