 President of Palestinian National Authority PNA Yasser Arafat today Condemned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's policies on peace process and sanctions against the Palestinians.
According to the Oslo accords, a permanent peace agreement should be signed between the Palestinians and Israel by the date.
Uzi Landau, chairman of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, told the Channel 1 that he will oppose Netanyahu's decision to hand further West Bank land to the Palestinians.
In his speech, Arafat briefed the council members about the current development in the Middle East peace process, the situation in the region and his discussions about the statehood issue with leaders of foreign countries he recently visited.
Netanyahu said the newly-concluded agreement established for the first time a concrete mechanism for the Palestinians to fulfill their security commitment before Israel hands over part of the West Bank to them.
By reluctantly embracing the Oslo peace accords and grudgingly advancing them through the Hebron and Wye agreements, he broke down the historic wall between Labor and Likud voters when it came to the peace process.
 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat not to declare an independent Palestinian State on May 4 this year.
He was commenting on the warning given by Palestinian National Authority PNA President Yasser Arafat that the Palestinian people would renew intifada uprising against Israel if the peace process collapses.
