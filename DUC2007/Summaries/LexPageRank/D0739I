With : Jerry Seinfeld.
There will be no next Seinfeld.
Seinfeld has vowed that he wo n't do another TV series, but before he bolts off again, he is going to perform, one final time, the stand-up comedy act he developed throughout his career.
 Is there life after Seinfeld?
Two months after laying to rest his famous TV show, comedian Jerry Seinfeld is performing last rites on his old standup routine, preparing for a finale in his hometown, New York City, that will be aired live as an HBO special on Aug. 9.
Janet Maslin, writing in The New York Times, was kinder : Sour Grapes should soften the blow of Seinfeld's imminent extinction with the good news that, in David's merry world of hair splitting and back stabbing, the dream definitely lives on.
In fact, he has n't even met formally with Seinfeld or David or NBC about a comedy series based on the wacky attorney, last seen as a rather funny punch line in a Honda TV ad.
For example : Despite his striking leading-man looks and effortless acting style, Jessie Martin was struggling until David E. Kelley cast him in a handful of episodes of Ally McBeal playing Ally's Calista Flockhart's love interest.
One crucial difference : Curb Your Enthusiasm violates half of David's famous no-hugging, no-learning rule of television.
