Last month Clinton for the firs time used the line-item authority, a power that the president can use to veto individual spending items in bills, to delete 38 projects in 24 states worth 287 million U.S. dollars from the fiscal 1998 military construction spending bill.
The line-item veto law was challenged by New York City and an Idaho potato growers group after U.S. President Bill Clinton vetoed provisions they sought that were granted by Congress.
 U.S. President Bill Clinton said Friday he will appeal a federal judge's ruling that struck down a law giving the president the power to veto specific items in bills passed by Congress.
Justice John Paul Stevens wrote the majority opinion for a court divided 6-to-3 in the line item veto case Clinton vs. City of New Article I, Section 7 of the U.S. Constitution : Every bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it becomes a law, be presented to the president of the United States ; if he approves he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, with objections to that House in which it shall have originated ... Returning a bill is a veto.
In February, a U.S. District Court here ruled the line-item veto unconstitutional, saying Congress violated the Constitution's separation of powers clause by delegating such authority to the president.
