Because of the risks of treatment, and its partial success rate, Hoofnagle said, doctors have tried to determine which patients truly need it rather than just giving the drugs to everyone with hepatitis C. Only 20 percent to 30 percent of people with chronic infections develop cirrhosis, liver failure or cancer.
In 1995, when she first learned she was infected, Mrs. Buchanan enrolled in a study that provided six months of treatment with Schering-Plough's version of the drug interferon, which eliminates the virus in 10 to 20 percent of patients.
Ribavirin is one of two components of a combination therapy approved last year by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of hepatitis C. Prison system health-care officials decided in June to begin treating prisoners with the combination therapy after a study showed that 29 percent of the state's inmates, or about 42,000 prisoners, were infected with the potentially lethal liver virus.
According to this week's New England Journal of Medicine, six months after treatment, patients who received the two-drug combination were more likely to be free of hepatitis C than they would be if they accepted the traditional drug treatment of interferon.
Di Bisceglie said the antiviral drug interferon had reduced symptoms in up to 20 percent of patients with hepatitis C who were treated for six months.
