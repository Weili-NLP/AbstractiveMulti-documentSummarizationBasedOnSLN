 Angelina Jolie, the disruptive mental patient in Girl, Interrupted, won the Academy Award for best supporting actress Sunday night, a generation after her father took home an Oscar.
 Gwyneth Paltrow of Shakespeare In Love and Michael Caine were honored Sunday for motion picture acting, and Michael J. Fox was a funny but poignant winner for TV comedy actor at the Golden Globes.
Angelina Jolie won best actress in a miniseries or TV movie for Gia, which also earned Faye Dunaway an award for supporting actress in a series, miniseries or TV movie.
The poll's other favorites also seemed to reflect pre-Oscar conventional wisdom : Denzel Washington for leading actor in The Hurricane, Hilary Swank for leading actress in Boys Do n't Cry, Michael Caine for supporting actor in The Cider House Rules, and Jolie for supporting actress.
Jolie, who turned 25 on Sunday, already has three Golden Globes, for the title role in the HBO movie Gia, about a supermodel who died of AIDS ; for the TV movie George Wallace ; and for last year's theatrical film Girl, Interrupted.
Matthew Harrigan, senior vice president at Denver-based investment firm Hanifren, Imhoff Inc., said the actions of new management seem to be putting MGM back on track.
