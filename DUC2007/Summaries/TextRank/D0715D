Despite a treaty signed by 135 countries to ban their use, production and stockpiling, anti-personnel land mines appear to be as popular as ever in fighting wars these days.
 Burkino Faso became the 40th country to ratify an international treaty to ban anti-personnel land mines Wednesday, meaning the treaty will go into effect in six months, the United Nations announced.
In a survey completed last April, the International Campaign to Ban Land Mines, which won the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize, reported that governments or rebel groups in at least 13 countries had used mines in the 15 months after the treaty was signed, though before it officially went into force.
In a statement, the ICBL expressed grave concern about reports of the continued laying of mines in a number of countries that have signed but not ratified the treaty, such as Angola, Cambodia, Senegal and Sudan.
A three-day conference on the land mines ban is being held in Ottawa, Canada, and most of the participating countries are expected to sign the treaty.
With a land mine treaty ratified in record time, they want every nation to sign it and the millions of land mines that continue to kill, maim and sow terror around the world removed.
 France and Germany on Thursday gave U.N. officials paperwork showing they have ratified a treaty banning anti-personnel land mines.
