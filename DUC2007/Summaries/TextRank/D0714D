The RIAA and the rock band Metallica have both sued Napster, alleging the company's software allows computer users to trade copyrighted music online without permission.
Napster, a company in San Mateo, Calif., that operates an online service, has cited those exemptions as a defense against lawsuits from major record companies, the heavy metal band Metallica and the rap artist Dr. Dre, who have accused it of engaging in vicarious copyright infringement.
Napster chief executive Hank Barry countered that the Web site's 20 million users have a right to share music under copyright law.
Until last week, when Metallica and the rapper Dr. Dre sued Napster for copyright infringement, the battle had been waged primarily by the music companies trade group, the Recording Industry Association of America.
 Thousands of Metallica fans booted by online music sharing software company Napster Inc. for allegedly swapping the heavy metal band's music want their access reinstated.
But the major record companies along with rock band Metallica and rap star Dr. Dre have sued Napster claiming the program promotes music piracy and cheats artists out of royalties.
The Napster software program allows Internet users to search for and download music directly from each others computer hard drives.
The suit claims Napster violated federal copyright and racketeering laws by allowing its users to share and swap Metallica songs on the Internet without charge.
