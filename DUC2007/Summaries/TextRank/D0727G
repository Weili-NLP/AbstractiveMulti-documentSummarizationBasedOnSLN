 The estranged wife of former U.S. House speaker Newt Gingrich wants a Cobb County, Ga., judge to freeze the couple's assets until their divorce is final.

Marianne Gingrich filed court papers in August accusing the former U.S. House speaker of attempting to transfer certain valuable assets before filing for divorce.
