 An employee of Martha's Vineyard Airport alerted federal aviation officials that John F. Kennedy Jr.'s plane was unaccounted for nearly four hours before a phone call from a Kennedy family friend early Saturday morning triggered a massive air and sea search.
Coast Guard Rear Adm. Richard M. Larrabee said his service and the Federal Aviation Administration began searching for the aircraft shortly after midnight when members of the Kennedy family said the plane had not arrived at an expected landing on Martha's Vineyard Friday night.
Jamie Gaspar, an operations specialist at Martha's Vineyard Airport, said Kennedy's plane was supposed to arrive Friday night, but never did.
 A small plane carrying John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister disappeared late Friday off the Massachusetts coast, and by Saturday afternoon the authorities had recovered debris from the airplane off Martha's Vineyard.
A. Kennedy took off from Essex County Airport in Fairfield, N.J. at 8:38 p.m. Friday night, flying a Piper Saratoga single-engine plane.
 Forty-eight hours after John F. Kennedy Jr.'s plane plunged into the ocean off Martha's Vineyard, federal officials Sunday ended their search for survivors, effectively declaring Kennedy, his wife and her sister the victims of a fatal crash.
 Federal investigators have concluded pilot error caused the plane crash that killed John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and his sister-in-law, NBC News reported Thursday.
