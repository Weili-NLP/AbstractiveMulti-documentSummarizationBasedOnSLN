 France's unemployment rate dropped by 1.6 percent in December last year, reducing the nation's jobless people to 2,583,600, said the Ministry of Employment Friday.
In a radio and television interview, Jospin said his government has decided to raise two welfare allowances by 3 percent Jan. 1 to ease the plight of France's unemployed.
The unemployment rate in France now stands at 11.2 percent, with 2,770,400 people in the labor force in search for a job.
Although France's unemployment rate has edged down to around 11.6 percent in recent months, jobless associations have been seeking to rekindle a protest movement which last year led to the occupation of dozens of unemployment offices across the country.
Unemployment in France fell to 11.6 percent in October from 11.7 percent, reflecting a slight improvement in the country's high jobless rate.
 The 12.5 percent unemployment rate is haunting the Christmas season in France as militants and unionists staged several protests over the past week against unemployment.
This is also the first time for the unemployment rate in France to be below 12.5 percent since September 1996.
 Thousands of jobless demonstrated across France on Monday to press the Socialist-led government for a bigger increase in unemployment benefits and a Christmas bonus.
A continuous drop of unemployment rate in France has been observed since July 1997, when the Socialist government led by Prime Minister Lionel Jospin came into power.
