 From the streets to government offices, earthquake relief workers and international agencies Friday pleaded with Turkey to turn its attention from the more than 10,000 dead and 35,000 missing from Tuesday's disaster to the hundreds of thousands of survivors left homeless, many at risk of disease.
The Bogazici Kandilli Observatory reported that the quake hit Izmit, about 110 kilometers west of Istanbul, the largest city of Turkey, at 11:11 local time 0811 GMT, driving people into a panic, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported.
 Some 26,000 survivors of the August 17, 1999 earthquake that devastated Izmit, Turkey's western industrial heartland in Marmara region, are still living in tents one year after the quake.
Turkey's Anatolia News Agency quoted Ismail Alakoc, the chairman of the boarding committee of Turkish Petrol Refineries Company as saying that the strong fire of the Izmit Refinery in Kocaeli province caused by Tuesday's devastating earthquake has been put out with the help of foreign countries.
 Some 12,040 people have so far been confirmed dead in Tuesday's killer earthquake in northwest Turkey and 33,495 others were reported as injured, the Government Crisis Center of Turkey announced Sunday morning.
Monday was the first day of the school year for most Turkish children, and Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit ordered schools in the affected areas closed until further notice.
