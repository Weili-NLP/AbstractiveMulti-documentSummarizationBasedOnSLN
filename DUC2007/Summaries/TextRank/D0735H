One of the wolves was out before the biologists could retreat from the pen, said Dave Parsons, head of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Mexican gray wolf recovery program, The wolves are native to Arizona, New Mexico and northern Mexico.
 &QL; WOLF KILLED-ARIZONA Undated Someone killed yet another endangered Mexican gray wolf in eastern Arizona, federal officials said Tuesday, the fifth lobo killed since the wolves were brought back to the wild this year.
 At the end of November, after bullets had felled 5 animals, biologists recaptured the last free-roaming survivor of 11 Mexican wolves released with fanfare just eight months earlier in Arizona's Apache National Forest, bringing a temporary halt to a celebrated 20-year cooperative program between the United States and Mexico to restore this distinctive subspecies of the gray wolf, which became extinct in the wild in 1977.
In contrast, Kieran Suckling, executive director of the Southwest Center for Biological Diversity, said the federal government should increase the reward leading to the arrest of the wolf killers to $ 50,000 and begin releasing wolves in the Gila and Aldo Leopold wilderness areas in New Mexico as well as the Blue.
The National Wildlife Federation said while the proposal reflects the success of wolf recovery programs, it falls far short of a bolder vision for recovery of wolves in the West.
