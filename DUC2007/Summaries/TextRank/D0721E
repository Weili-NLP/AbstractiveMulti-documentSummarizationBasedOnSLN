 Aaron J. McKinney killed a gay student at the University of Wyoming last year in a five-minute emotional rage because the student, Matthew Shepard, had made sexual advances that reminded him of homosexual abuse he had suffered as a child, McKinney's lawyer told a jury on Monday as his murder trial began here.
 Jurors saw photographs of Matthew Shepard's bloody face as prosecutors began presenting their case against Aaron McKinney, accused of beating the gay student to death in a drunken, drug-induced rage.
Well before Shepard's murder, a sharp increase in police reports of anti-gay bias crimes in New York City had unsettled gay people, shaking them out of what some call complacency in the years since the height of AIDS activism.
As a bartender at the Fireside Lounge in Laramie, Wyo., Galloway was one of the last people to see Matthew Shepard alive 17 months ago before two local roofers lured him into a truck, beat him, robbed him and left him for dead on a wooden fence on the outskirts all because Shepard, a 21-year-old student at the University of Wyoming, was gay.
