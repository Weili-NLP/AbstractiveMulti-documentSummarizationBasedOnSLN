 Some Senate Democrats said Tuesday they will seriously consider a resolution drafted by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D.-Calif., condemning President Clinton's conduct in trying to cover up his affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
Its political action committee met this week to plan ways to promote Feinstein, California's senior senator, as vice president on the Democratic ticket in 2000.

 Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer announced Thursday they will wield gavels during the 2000 Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles next month as the first two women co-chairs of a national political convention.
