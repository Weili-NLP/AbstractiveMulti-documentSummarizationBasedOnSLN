 A governing party town councilor was killed Wednesday by a bomb in an attack believed to be carried out by the armed Basque separatist group ETA, national Spanish radio reported.
 The Spanish government of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar and the Basque militant group ETA have made direct contact for the first time, taking a step toward new peace talks, a newspaper reported Thursday.
While not directly supporting ETA attacks, Herri Batasuna leader Jon Idigoras told Saturday's marchers that the repression of radical Basque nationalism by the government, only lengthens the conflict unnecessarily and causes unnecessary victims, the national news agency EFE reported.
 The Spanish government has ruled out any discussion of Basque independence in expected peace talks with the armed separatist group ETA, a government spokesman said Tuesday.
 The armed Basque separatist group ETA reiterated its willingness Monday to open peace negotiations with the government, but fell short of announcing a permanent cease-fire as has been demanded by Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar.
ETA, which stands for Basque Homeland and Freedom, has killed nearly 800 people in its 30-year campaign for an independent Basque nation carved out of parts of northern Spain and southern France.
ETA regularly targets the Basque business community as part of its independence campaign.
The government insists, however, that the agenda will not include the subject of Basque independence.
