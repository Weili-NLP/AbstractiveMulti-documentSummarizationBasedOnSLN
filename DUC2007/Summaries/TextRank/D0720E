 President of Palestinian National Authority PNA Yasser Arafat today Condemned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's policies on peace process and sanctions against the Palestinians.
 A senior Palestinian National Authority PNA official Thursday urged Israel to implement the Oslo accords and the Hebron agreement in a bid to move the Mideast peace process forward.
In a speech at the ceremony held in Ramallah, West Bank, to mark the 50th anniversary of the 1948 Israeli-Arab war, Arafat renewed his pledge that he would declare Palestinian independence in May 1999 at the end of the Oslo process, even in the absence of a final peace agreement with Israel.
Following months of secret talks held in Oslo, the Israeli and Palestinian negotiators reached agreement on August 20 of 1993 on principles of Palestinian self-rule, widely-known later as the Oslo Accords which started the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
 In a stern warning to Israel, Palestinian National Authority PNA President Yasser Arafat said Thursday that Palestinians are ready to renew the intifada uprising if the peace process collapses.
The fifth anniversary of the Oslo Accords has been marked by clashes between the Palestinians and Israeli soldiers, the Israeli closure of the West Bank and Gaza, and massive peace demonstrations in Israel.
Under the Oslo accords, Israel should transfer all remaining West Bank territories to Palestinian control during the third redeployment.
