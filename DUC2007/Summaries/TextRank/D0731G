 U.S. House investigators on Tuesday made public Linda Tripp's secretly recorded tapes of Monica Lewinsky's tales of her affair with U.S. President Bill Clinton.
The Tripp tapes were the basis for Kenneth Starr's investigation into President Clinton's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
 Maryland prosecutors have asked the federal judge overseeing a grand jury investigation of President Clinton for access to Linda Tripp's secret tape recordings of Monica Lewinsky, a newspaper reported.
 The tapes that Linda Tripp secretly made of telephone conversations with Monica Lewinsky may not be released next week with other evidence given to Congress by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde said Thursday.
Tripp was indicted last July for illegally taping phone conversations with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
 The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Dec. 19 : The attempt by a Maryland prosecutor to try Linda Tripp on state wiretapping charges for secretly tape-recording her telephone conversations with Monica Lewinsky has revived passions that have been dormant since President Clinton's impeachment trial.
A conservative legal group, Judicial Watch, had argued for the material to be made public alleging that political pressure from the Clinton administration drove the grand jury to investigate whether Ms. Tripp broke Maryland law by recording phone conversations with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
