 Issuing a verdict that civil rights organizations hope will bankrupt one of the nation's largest white-supremacist groups and limit its ability to preach hate, a state jury in northern Idaho Thursday ordered leaders of the Aryan Nations to pay more than $ 6 million to the victims of an attack two years ago by men who were serving as security guards at the group's compound near here.
A who's who of the hate movement visited the place over the years, including William Pierce, author of a book about a race war called The Turner Diaries that allegedly inspired Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh ; former Texas Klan leader Louis Beam ; and Tom Metzger of the White Aryan Resistance, who lost his house and possessions to a SPLC lawsuit.
Buford R. Furrow Jr., a former Aryan Nations security guard charged with killing a Los Angeles postal worker and wounding five in an attack on a Jewish day-care center, is the latest Butler disciple to make news for racist violence.
 Morris S. Dees Jr., who has won a series of civil rights suits against the Ku Klux Klan and other racist groups in a campaign to put them out of business, came to court here Monday to try to seize the Aryan Nations compound that has nurtured white supremacists for more than 20 years.
