One study by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that the number of Americans considered obese -- defined as being more than 30 percent over their ideal body weight -- soared from about one in eight in 1991 to nearly one in five last year
this study are based on data relating to a person 's degree of obesity to their risks of five major diseases -- coronary heart disease , type 2 diabetes , stroke , high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol examined the health and economic benefits of sustained moderate weight loss of 10 percent among persons who are overweight or obese Published in the October issue of the American Journal of Public Health does nothing to suggest that that has changed
Another study in this week's JAMA issue on obesity -- all of the studies involved Americans at least the age of 18 -- attributed an estimated average of about 280,000 deaths a year to being overweight
