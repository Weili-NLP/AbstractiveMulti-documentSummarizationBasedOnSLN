The Justice Department's landmark antitrust trial and earlier legal actions against the Microsoft Corp. have cost $ 13.3 million over the past decade
Microsoft has launched a new attack , arguing Caldera has not uncovered evidence to support its claims that Microsoft has used illegal marketing and licensing tactics filed an unexpected brief with a federal judge on Monday that quoted from a 5-year-old government legal document in which the Justice Department argued that breaking up Microsoft would be `` against the public interest `` dangerous to the economy 's welfare
The nine-page brief gives Microsoft the final word before a hearing on Wednesday but risks irritating the judge , Thomas Penfield Jackson , who did not ask for another filing from Microsoft when he laid out the schedule for the remedy phase of the case
That document was part of the public record from an older antitrust case against Microsoft , the Justice Department 's first suit against the company called for IBM to promote Microsoft 's software on IBM personal computers
Jackson wrote that Microsoft violated the Sherman Antitrust Act to force Microsoft to reimburse its legal costs
Caldera's response to Microsoft's arguments will be filed next month
The government , of course , had recognized that IBM 's size , reach and complicated history with Microsoft could be used by Microsoft 's lawyers to try to undercut its contentions opposed Microsoft 's merger with Intuit Inc. early in the 1990s and negotiated a consent decree with the software giant in a related antitrust lawsuit in 1995
