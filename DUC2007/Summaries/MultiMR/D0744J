 More than two years after the federal government's first effort to define and regulate organic food failed to win public approval, the Department of Agriculture is announcing much tougher rules that prohibit the use of genetically modified ingredients in products carrying the organic label.
The national standards could help U.S. producers sell organic food abroad, where there has been substantial opposition to the use of genetically modified crops and other new food technologies.
Sales of organic food have been increasing about 20 percent a year.
And processed food containing at least 50 percent organic ingredients could be labeled made with organic ingredients and list up to three of them.
Several advocates of organic farming who have seen the revised rules say that the standards are stricter than those developed in any other country and have set the bar very high for organic farmers in the United States, possibly discouraging rather than encouraging them to grow organic crops.
When a label says grown and processed in accordance with the California Organic Foods Act of 1990, it does not necessarily mean the food is truly organic, according to the organic foods industry, farmers, inspectors and others.
 Consumers once could find organic food products only in specialty stores.
Organic vegetables and fruits, already well known to consumers, now are being used in a variety of products, including baby food.
When the Agriculture Department proposed organic food regulations, more than 280,000 people filed comments protesting the inclusion of genetically modified foods as organic.
