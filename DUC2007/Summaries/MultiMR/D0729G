About 100 investigative officers from the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and local sheriffs departments are hunting for fugitive Eric Robert Rudolph in the 530,000-acre Nantahala National Forest, a rugged area at the state's western tip.
There have been no reported sighting of Rudolph since July 11, when health food store owner George Nordmann told authorities Rudolph had come to his home in nearby Nantahala and taken six months worth of food and supplies.
During a news conference, Enderson was pressed on why federal law enforcement officers have n't named Rudolph a suspect or charged him with the July 1996 deadly pipe-bomb explosion in Centennial Olympic Park, the January 1997 double blast at a Sandy Springs abortion clinic or a February 1997 bomb at an Atlanta gay nightclub.
Rudolph's truck was seen leaving the area of the Birmingham bombing, and the fugitive disappeared Jan. 30 into the western North Carolina mountains.
Agents found trash in July after Rudolph came out of the woods to get six more months of food, NOW and Nature's Plus minerals and vitamins, supplies and a truck from George Nordmann, a 71-year-old Andrews health food store owner.
 After five and a half months in hiding, the man wanted for the fatal bombing of an Alabama abortion clinic emerged from the woods of western North Carolina last week, took a large amount of food and a pickup truck from a residence, then abandoned the truck and vanished once more, federal authorities said on Tuesday.
All along, Enderson said, investigators have believed Rudolph was hiding in the mountains of western North Carolina.
