 Turkey is angry over the European Union EU's decision to exclude it from a European defense mechanism, warning the EU not to take for granted the use of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization NATO facilities in Turkey for EU-led operations.
Turkish Daily News reported on Wednesday that Ankara was not satisfied with the EU decision made Tuesday at the EU summit in Portugal to exclude non-EU members from the so-called European Security and Defense Identity ESDI.
In a statement, Turkish Foreign Ministry called on EU members to reverse its decision at its next summit in Nice, France, in December.
Turkey, a NATO member and EU candidate, has endeavoured to join the European defense mechanism with the support of the U.S., who fears the ESDI will take the place of the NATO and reduce Washington's role in the European security affairs.
 The European Parliament today voted to block a 53 million ECU 70 million U.S. dollars special aid package to Turkey because of what it called a deterioration in the human rights situation in the country.
The special aid is part of the agreement between the European Union EU and Turkey on the establishment of a customs union between the two sides.
The European Parliament also called on the European Commission not to allow Turkey access to EU aid under the Meda program for Mediterranean countries, except for projects concerning the promotion of democracy and human rights.
 Turkey's foreign minister on Thursday said the European Union's definition of Turkey as a candidate for membership will pave the way to improved relations between Brussels and Ankara.
