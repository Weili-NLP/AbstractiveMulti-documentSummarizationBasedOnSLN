Currently, the drug of choice is interferon, which produces remission or suppression of the virus in about 20 percent of cases.
Ward has just finished a year of treatment on the only drug that works on hepatitis C : interferon.
Ribavirin is one of two components of a combination therapy approved last year by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of hepatitis C. Prison system health-care officials decided in June to begin treating prisoners with the combination therapy after a study showed that 29 percent of the state's inmates, or about 42,000 prisoners, were infected with the potentially lethal liver virus.
One, led by researchers at the Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation in La Jolla, Calif., found that six months after treatment, a combination of interferon and a drug called ribavirin was 31 to 38 percent effective among patients being treated for the first time.
Of the 4 million Americans estimated to have been infected, it's estimated that 30,000 will die by 2010 because of liver disease caused by chronic hepatitis C virus.
For 15 to 20 percent of people infected with hepatitis C, the virus simply goes away.
 The Food and Drug Administration Wednesday approved the expanded use of Rebetron, a treatment already on the market for hepatitis C, a viral infection of the liver that can lead to cirrhosis, liver cancer and liver failure.
Rebetron, made by the Schering-Plough Corp., was approved in June only for patients who had relapsed after taking interferon drugs, the only other approved treatment for the disease.
