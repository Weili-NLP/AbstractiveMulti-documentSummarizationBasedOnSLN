 Russia reiterated Thursday that its cooperation with Iran in the nuclear industry fully conforms to all international commitments of Moscow and Tehran, including those on the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons.
 In a rare interview to an Israeli TV station, Pakistan's minister of information said Friday that his country was not cooperating with Iran on nuclear technology.
Israel has long feared Iran's growing weapons program and warned of ties between Iran and Pakistan after last months nuclear testing by Pakistan and India.
Pakistan has no cooperation with any other country on the nuclear issue or the missile issue, Mushahid Hussein said in an interview with Israel's Channel 2 TV.
Israel has relations with India but not Pakistan, the first Muslim country to go nuclear.
We have no idea what other countries in the region are doing, not Iran, Iraq or Israel, he said.
Officials from the Russian and Iranian foreign ministries held consultations in Tehran on July 15-16 to discuss the problem of disarmament, non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and export controls, according to the Itar-Tass news agency.
At the same time, Moscow and Tehran confirmed the inalienable right of all countries to acquire and develop atomic energy for peaceful purposes.
Iran's new missiles are not yet operational, and Tehran remains at least five, and probably more, years away from developing nuclear weapons.
 The commander of Israel's armed forces said Monday that Israel has to be ready for a pre-emptive strike against Iran, should this become necessary.
