The Defense Department has spent about 4 billion U.S. dollars on THAAD so far.
 U.S. Defense Department said Wednesday that it would continue testing its costly anti-missile defense system despite five consecutive test failures.
The Theater High-Altitude Area Defense THAAD failed to intercept a target ballistic missile during a test at the White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico.
The missile system, built by Lockheed Martin Corp., is designed to protect troops in the field from attack by Scud and other short and medium-range missiles.
President Bill Clinton's budget request for missile defense seeks 822 million dollars for continued testing and development of THAAD next year and the House National Security Committee has endorsed that figure.
 The U.S. military successfully tested an anti-missile defense system Thursday by destroying a missile with another one high over New Mexico State, the Defense Department said.
The U.S. Army's Theater High-Altitude Area Defense THAAD missile hit and destroyed a Hera test rocket in flight over White Sands, New Mexico State.
 Iran's weekend test of a long-range missile underscored the need for a U.S. national missile defense system, Secretary of Defense William Cohen said Monday.
The Defense Department planned to develop weapons for a national missile defense system by 1999 and then to decide whether to deploy it within three years.
A land-based national missile defense system, under study by the Clinton administration, would cost an estimated $ 10.5 billion to build and, if approved, would n't be deployed until 2005.
