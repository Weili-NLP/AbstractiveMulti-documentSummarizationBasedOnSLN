 A 5.2-magnitude earthquake, followed by another one of magnitude 4.6, rocked western Turkey Tuesday, but the casualties from the quake are not immediately known.
The Bogazici Kandilli Observatory reported that the quake hit Izmit, about 110 kilometers west of Istanbul, the largest city of Turkey, at 11:11 local time 0811 GMT, driving people into a panic, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported.
So far, in addition to the thousands killed and injured, the quake did extensive damage to residential and industrial buildings in Izmit and nearby towns in a major industrial center, and left more than 100,000 homeless.
 Some 12,040 people have so far been confirmed dead in Tuesday's killer earthquake in northwest Turkey and 33,495 others were reported as injured, the Government Crisis Center of Turkey announced Sunday morning.
 Blaze in a refinery in western Turkey has been put out thanks to the strong efforts made by foreign rescue experts, a Turkish official said on Sunday.
Turkey's Anatolia News Agency quoted Ismail Alakoc, the chairman of the boarding committee of Turkish Petrol Refineries Company as saying that the strong fire of the Izmit Refinery in Kocaeli province caused by Tuesday's devastating earthquake has been put out with the help of foreign countries.
 At least seven people died Monday and hundreds were injured when a severe tremor shook Turkey in the same region where more than 15,000 people were killed in a huge earthquake less than a month ago.
