 A United Nations World Heritage committee called Wednesday for the scrapping of the proposed Jabiluka uranium mine in Australia's Northern Territory.
The mission therefore recommends that the proposal to mine and mill uranium at Jabiluka should not proceed, the committee said in its report following a visit to Kakadu last month.
The report said the mine, which could process 19.5 million metric tons of uranium ore over its 28-year life, could damage the environment.
The miner, Energy Resources of Australia Limited, told the panel that its project does not threaten the environmental and cultural values of Kakadu, which are recognized by the United Nations World Heritage Bureau.
 The Australian federal government Thursday rejected a UNESCO report which called for Kakadu National Park in northwest Australia to be placed on the endangered list because of the threat posed by the Jabiluka uranium mine.
Construction begun one week ago at Jabiluka, a uranium mining lease lying within the boundaries of Kakadu National Park, listed by the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization on its World Heritage list of important cultural and environmental sites.
 The Australian government has mounted a systematic attack on the traditions of the Aboriginal people living in Kakadu National Park, a U.N. team investigating whether uranium mining threatens the park was told Tuesday.
The Age Australian conservationists and traditional aboriginal owners threatened to blockade development of the huge Jabiluka uranium mine in the country's vast Kakadu National Park, which is on the World Heritage List, after the federal government approved the mining plan for the Jabilika mine yesterday.
