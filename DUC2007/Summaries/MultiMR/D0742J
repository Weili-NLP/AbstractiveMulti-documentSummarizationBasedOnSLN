 Federal investigators have concluded pilot error caused the plane crash that killed John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and his sister-in-law, NBC News reported Thursday.
The NTSB also is likely to point to a host of factors the night of July 16, when the plane Kennedy was piloting crashed off the Massachusetts island of Martha's Vineyard : thick haze, the darkness of night, and the fact Kennedy was flying over open water with no lights below to guide him.
Kennedy's single-engine Piper Saratoga crashed as he was flying with his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister Lauren, from Fairfield, N.J., near New York City, to Martha's Vineyard.
 A small plane carrying John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister disappeared late Friday off the Massachusetts coast, and by Saturday afternoon the authorities had recovered debris from the airplane off Martha's Vineyard.
The Federal Aviation Administration reported that the last contact with the plane came at 9:39 p.m. when it was 17 miles southwest of Martha's Vineyard, the Coast Guard said in a statement.
Kennedy, who obtained a pilot's license last year, did not file a flight plan and did not make radio contact with air controllers during the flight, officials said.
 Forty-eight hours after John F. Kennedy Jr.'s plane plunged into the ocean off Martha's Vineyard, federal officials Sunday ended their search for survivors, effectively declaring Kennedy, his wife and her sister the victims of a fatal crash.
