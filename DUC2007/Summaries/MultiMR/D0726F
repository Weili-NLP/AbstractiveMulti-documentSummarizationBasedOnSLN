 Vice President Al Gore will take his first formal step toward running for president in 2000 by notifying the Federal Election Commission that he has formed a campaign organization, aides to the vice president said Thursday.
Craig Smith, a longtime aide to President Clinton, most recently as the White House political adviser, has been hired as Gore's campaign manager, a sign that he intends to draw heavily on people and grass-roots organizations that helped Clinton become the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to win successive terms as president.
An aide to the vice president said the campaign committee would also include Peter Knight, Clinton's campaign chairman in 1996 and former Gore chief of staff ; another former vice presidential chief of staff, Jack Quinn ; the current chief, Ron Klain, and former Rep. Tom Downey, D-N.Y., who is one of Gore's best friends.
 Vice President Al Gore appealed to black members of Congress and their guests Wednesday night to help turn out voters next year to keep a Democrat in the White House and return control of the House to Democrats.
Since the start of President Clinton's administration more blacks have become home and business owners as well as federal judges than ever before, he said.
 Vice President Al Gore received the endorsement of his boss wife Tuesday as he sought to rally women behind his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.
