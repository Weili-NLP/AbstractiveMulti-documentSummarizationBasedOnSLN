This all speaks to what most Internet companies are facing, and that's the high cost of customer acquisition, said Howard Schultz, Starbucks chairman and chief executive.
Despite a strong core retail business, some of Starbucks other businesses have n't grown as expected, CEO Howard Schultz said in a conference call.
Company executives had expected that strong retail sales in Starbucks core coffee business would make up the difference, but that did n't happen, Schultz said.
Schultz said the company plans to create a canopy brand Web site that will include sales of gourmet food, kitchen products and home furnishings as well as coffee products and music.
By expanding Starbucks online sales beyond coffee, Schultz said the company is taking a crack at potential revenues estimated at $ 100 billion.
According to Starbucks, more than 75 percent of the company's customers use the Internet, and they have an average income of more than $ 70,000.
Starbucks has sold jazz CDs in its coffee shops for several years and considers music an important part of how customers experience its brand, said Bonnie Kramer Tonneson, an analyst with Hambrecht & Quist.
 &QL; Coffee giant Starbucks Corp. has purchased Hear Music, an upscale music retailer that until recently was based in San Francisco, for under $ 10 million.
We have less than 5 percent of the overall coffee market in America, said Schultz.
