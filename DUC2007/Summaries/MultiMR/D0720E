 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat not to declare an independent Palestinian State on May 4 this year.
Netanyahu opposes unilateral Palestinian statehood declaration, threatening to annex parts of the West Bank now under Israeli control.
He was commenting on the warning given by Palestinian National Authority PNA President Yasser Arafat that the Palestinian people would renew intifada uprising against Israel if the peace process collapses.
Speaking Thursday at the ceremony held in Ramallah to mark the 50th anniversary of the 1948 Israeli-Arab war, Arafat renewed his pledge that he would declare Palestinian independence in May 1999 at the end of the Oslo process, even in the absence of a final peace agreement with Israel.
 Israeli senior cabinet ministers today failed to reach agreement on a plan for the Israeli army's redeployment from the disputed West Bank town of Hebron, Israel Radio reported.
Early this month, Palestinian Council Speaker Ahmed Queria stressed that the Palestinians would not open new negotiations on the Hebron issue, saying the Israeli troops should pull out in accordance with the Oslo accords.
 When the historic Oslo Accords were signed in Washington today five years ago, the Palestinians were promised land and the Israelis peace.
Addressing the meeting of the Palestine Liberation Organization PLO Central Council, Arafat said the outcome and fate of the Palestinian people's struggle have asked the Palestinian leadership to declare an independent Palestinian state in the territories on time.
According to the Oslo accords, a permanent peace agreement should be signed between the Palestinians and Israel by the date.
