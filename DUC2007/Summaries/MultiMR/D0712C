 British author Salman Rushdie, speaking after Iran distanced itself from an Islamic death sentence against him, said Thursday that it appeared his nearly 10-year ordeal had ended.
This looks like its over, Rushdie said.
At the United Nations in New York, Iran's foreign minister said his government was distancing itself from the reward for killing Rushdie, and was ready to exchange ambassadors with Britain.
However, the Iranian culture minister did not say whether Iran intends to drop late religious leader Ayatollah Khomeini's fatwa against Salman Rushdie.
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said during his recent trip to central Asian states that Iran will resume talks with the European Union EU on the Rushdie issue.
On 14 February 1989, late Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini issued a religious edict, pronouncing a sentence of death on British author Salman Rushdie and his publishers in protest against the publication of Rushdie's novel The Satanic Verses, and exhorting all Moslems to carry out the sentence.
Rushdie has been protected by the government since 1989, when the Iranian religious leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini decreed that the author of The Satanic Verses should be killed.
 An Iranian foundation has added dlrs 300,000 to the reward for Salman Rushdie's death, just weeks after the Iranian government tried to distance itself from the bounty.
 The British government said Wednesday that it would continue to press Iran to lift the death sentence against the author Salman Rushdie when its foreign secretary, Robin Cook, meets the Iranian foreign minister in New York on Thursday.
