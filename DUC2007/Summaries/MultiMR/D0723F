 Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said she will vote against both articles of impeachment because House prosecutors failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that President Clinton committed perjury and obstructed justice in the Monica Lewinsky matter.
Therefore, this president, who has been a good president for the people of the United States, should not be convicted and removed from office, Feinstein said.
Feinstein's California colleague, Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., also said Thursday that she would vote to acquit Clinton.
 Seeking her second full term in the U.S. Senate, Democrat Dianne Feinstein has more campaign money than all of her would-be opponents combined, a commanding lead in public opinion polls and virtually no opposition for her party's own nomination.
Her popularity in California is one reason she is frequently mentioned as a possible running mate for Vice President Al Gore, should he win the Democratic presidential nomination.
After the Senate voted to acquit Clinton, Feinstein tried to bring up her censure resolution.
Tom Campbell has won elections, said Jim Jordan, political director for the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee.
Senator Feinstein has been a good senator, Campbell said Tuesday.
U.S. drug companies appeared poised to win a battle in that fight early on Wednesday, when the Senate was considering an African trade bill that would have allowed the U.S. Trade Representative to impose sanctions on Sub-Saharan African countries that produce cheaper generic versions of U.S. AIDS drugs.
