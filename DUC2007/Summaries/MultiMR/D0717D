 Shares of American Home Products Corp. fell sharply on Friday after a ruling by a federal judge that could allow patients in up to 44 states to collectively sue the company for the cost of monitoring their health after they took two diet drugs, known as fen-phen.
The ruling late Thursday by U.S. District Judge Louis Bechtle in Philadelphia conditionally certified a class-action lawsuit against the company by patients who took the drugs Pondimin and Redux before they were withdrawn from the market in 1997.
Pondimin and Redux, two prescription diet drugs often taken in combination, were taken off the market in 1997 at the request of the Food and Drug Administration after some users developed heart-valve damage.
The other half of fen-phen, phentermine, was never associated with that damage when taken alone and is still on the market.
In October 1999, American Home agreed to pay $ 3.75 billion to settle thousands of lawsuits filed nationwide by people claiming health problems due to fen-phen.
 Opponents of a proposed $ 3.75 billion national settlement of health claims against the diet drug combination fen-phen called the deal inadequate Tuesday as a judge began hearing testimony on the fairness of the settlement.
More than 9,000 lawsuits have been filed against Madison, N.J.-based American Home, maker of fenfluramine, the fen in the fen-phen combination.
The company pulled Pondimin and Redux off the market in 1997 after a Mayo Clinic study linked fenfluramine to potentially fatal heart valve damage.
