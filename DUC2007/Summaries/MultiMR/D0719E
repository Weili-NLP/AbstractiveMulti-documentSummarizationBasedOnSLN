In its 1997 Economic Survey report on France published today, the OECD, which groups 29 industrialized nations, gave credit to the French government over economic growth and cutting public deficits.
It said that France's economic growth rate could attain 2.5 percent in 1997, and 2.6 percent in 1998, while its public deficit could drop to 3.2 percent of its gross domestic product GDP by the end of 1997.
 French President Jacques Chirac said Monday that the government should be particularly careful about the problem of social exclusion, which results from long time unemployment.
 Unemployment fell to 11.6 percent in October from 11.7 percent, the Labor Ministry said Friday.
Protests were staged in some 60 cities throughout the country against a 3 percent rise in unemployment benefits announced by Prime Minister Lionel Jospin last week, which jobless associations say is too small.
Although France's unemployment rate has edged down to around 11.6 percent in recent months, jobless associations have been seeking to rekindle a protest movement which last year led to the occupation of dozens of unemployment offices across the country.
 France's unemployment rate dropped slightly to 11.5 percent in November, but nearly 3 million people remain without a job, the Labor Ministry said Friday.
 The unemployment rate in France dropped by 0.3 percent to stand at 12.4 percent in November, said the Ministry of Employment Tuesday.
This is also the first time for the unemployment rate in France to be below 12.5 percent since September 1996.
