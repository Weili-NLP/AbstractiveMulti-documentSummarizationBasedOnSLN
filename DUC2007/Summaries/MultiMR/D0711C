 The government and Microsoft have been summoned to Chicago on Tuesday for their first round of settlement talks under Richard Posner, the federal appeals court judge who has been selected as a mediator, according to a person close to the antitrust case.
Besides Posner, who is chief judge of the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago, the meeting will include lawyers representing Microsoft and the Justice Department and 19 states suing the company.
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson has told both sides that, barring a settlement, he will issue a verdict in the case as soon as Tuesday, and no one doubts that he will find Microsoft in broad violation of antitrust law.
 Ebullient over their legal victory against Microsoft, Justice Department antitrust officials said Monday that they would examine possible remedies to put an end what a federal judge described as the company's monopolistic practices.
In his ruling, Federal District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson wrote that Microsoft violated the Sherman Antitrust Act.
He said the ruling showed how no company is above the law.
 Microsoft Corp., whose business practices are being challenged by the government in a major antitrust case, suffered a legal setback on another front Tuesday when a federal judge in California ordered the company to stop shipping Internet software that violates its contract with a rival, Sun Microsystems Inc..
The judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson of U.S. District Court, sided with the government on the most important points in its exhaustive antitrust suit, though he surprised lawyers on both sides by ruling for Microsoft in one area.
