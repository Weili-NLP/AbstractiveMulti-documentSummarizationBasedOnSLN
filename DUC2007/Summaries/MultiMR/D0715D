 The International Campaign to Ban Landmines has called on all 14 member states of Southern African Development Community SADC to join the mine ban treaty, report reached here said on Friday.
Forty-five of the 53 nations in Africa have signed the treaty, which prohibits use, production, trade in or stockpiling of antipersonnel mines.
Nations that ratify the treaty pledge to destroy all stockpiles of mines within four years and clear all mines from their territory within 10 years.
The United States has refused to sign or ratify the treaty, maintaining such weapons are needed on the Korean peninsula to deter North Korea from invading South Korea.
Tens of millions of land mines are scattered in more than 60 countries, and they kill or injure an estimated 20,000 people each year, mostly innocent civilians.
Last December, the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, and its American coordinator, Jody Williams, won the Nobel Peace Prize for its six years of worldwide campaigning that resulted in 122 countries signing the treaty in Ottawa last year.
 The South African Campaign Against Landmines has called on President Bill Clinton of the United States to sign a treaty banning landmines.
The treaty, concluded in Ottawa in 1997, has been signed by 133 countries and ratified by 65 of them.
A conference on the land mine ban will be held in Ottawa on December 2-4 when those participating countries are expected to sign the treaty.
