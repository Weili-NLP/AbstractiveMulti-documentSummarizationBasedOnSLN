His suit contends that compound guards, the Aryan Nations, its 82-year-old founder, Richard Girnt Butler, and his second in command, Michael Teague, should be held liable for an attack on a woman and her son, both white, by the guards in July 1998.
In a lawsuit that goes to trial Monday, attorney Morris Dees of the Southern Poverty Law Center is representing a mother and son who were attacked by security guards for the white supremacist group.
 Issuing a verdict that civil rights organizations hope will bankrupt one of the nation's largest white-supremacist groups and limit its ability to preach hate, a state jury in northern Idaho Thursday ordered leaders of the Aryan Nations to pay more than $ 6 million to the victims of an attack two years ago by men who were serving as security guards at the group's compound near here.
The verdict was obtained by lawyers for the Southern Poverty Law Center, a nonprofit organization in Birmingham, Ala., that has successfully sued the Ku Klux Klan and other racist organizations.
But the larger purpose of the lawsuit was to bankrupt the Aryan Nations compound, limit Butler's ability to spread a gospel of racial hate and persuade the jury to return a verdict that will be heard all over this nation, a lawyer for the Keenans, Dees said in closing arguments.
This is nothing, Butler said.
The Southern Poverty Law Center represented the predominantly black Macedonia Baptist Church in Clarendon County, which won a $ 21.5 million judgment against the Christian Knights and Klan members after the church was burned four years ago.
