For the past month, the Pemon tribe has been trying to block the 300-mile 480-kilometer power line's construction, saying it will damage the environment by supplying electricity to gold mining companies that want to set up operations in the Imataca rain forest.
Toco officials were quoted on Wednesday by the media as saying that in next three years this mine's diamond production will reach between 600,000 and 700,000 karats, and will become Latin America s second largest diamond mine, the first position being a similar mine in Canada.
 About 400 Indians blocked Venezuela's main highway to Brazil with huge logs to protest a high-voltage power line being built in the Lost World of Amazon rain forests.
The line is to supply electricity to Brazil, Indian communities in Venezuela and gold mining companies that plan to come to Venezuela to extract some of the largest gold deposits in Latin America.
Participants from mining sectors of 14 countries, including Argentina, Australia, Chile, Brazil, the United States, Peru, Colombia and Venezuela, are scheduled to discuss the international economic crisis and the development of Argentina's mining industry.
Meilan added that from 1996 to 2000, the total investment in Argentina's mining sector would be around 3.5 billion U.S. dollars, which will help increase gold exports from 32 million to 1.3 billion dollars.
 Peru turned out 56.4 tons of gold in 1995, representing an increase of 18 percent over the previous year, the Energy and Mining Ministry said today.
