 The armed Basque separatist group ETA reiterated its willingness Monday to open peace negotiations with the government, but fell short of announcing a permanent cease-fire as has been demanded by Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar.
The organization, blamed for nearly 800 killings in its 30-year-old battle for an independent Basque homeland in northern Spain, began an open-ended, unconditional cease-fire Sept. 18.
 It's election time in Spain's troubled Basque region, bringing with it a flurry of attempts to end three decades of violence in which nearly 800 people have been killed by ETA rebels fighting for an independent Basque homeland.
Pressure on ETA to declare a unilateral cease-fire has increased since Saturday, when Basque nationalists and other political groups, including radical ETA-linked political party Herri Batasuna, took a joint position on the issue.
ETA, the initials in the Basque language for Basque Homeland and Freedom, and Basque political parties seek an independent nation carved out of pieces of northern Spain and southern France.
Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's government insists it will not negotiate with ETA or its political allies until ETA renounces violence.
 A governing party town councilor was killed Wednesday by a bomb in an attack believed to be carried out by the armed Basque separatist group ETA, national Spanish radio reported.
ETA, a Basque language acronym for Basque Homeland and Freedom, has killed nearly 800 people since beginning its campaign for an independent Basque state in 1968.
