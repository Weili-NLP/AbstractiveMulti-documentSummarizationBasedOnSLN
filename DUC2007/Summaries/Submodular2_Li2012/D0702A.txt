This year, the 14-year-old program involved 22,000 students and 733 teachers at 176 schools in New York.
Dance is an indispensable part of the curriculum for all 750 students at Public School 156, along with music, art and creative writing.
Having started with 300 children from one school, Inner City Arts now caters to 8,000 children annually from 11 public schools who attend classes twice a week for six weeks.
High school students who take music lessons and join theater groups do better in math, reading, history, geography and citizenship, according to a study of Education Department data to be published today.
While Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Chancellor Rudy Crew have goaded schools to focus on reading and math, they have also increased the arts education budget by $ 150 million since 1997, providing about 1,000 art and music teachers and supplies for the city's 1,100 public schools.
The study also found that as students progress through high school they are less likely to be involved in the arts.
We know that a lot of our young children learn better if they have access to music education, Clinton said.
If you can enhance people's spatial ability through a program of music instruction, we're not sure why, but most kids would benefit.
But they did n't find any solid evidence that music, art and dance improve reading, or that classes in the arts improve test scores.
