On 14 February 1989, late Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini issued a religious edict, pronouncing a sentence of death on British author Salman Rushdie and his publishers in protest against the publication of Rushdie's novel The Satanic Verses, and exhorting all Moslems to carry out the sentence.
On Thursday, Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi distanced his government from a dlrs 2.5 million reward for Rushdie's death.
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued the fatwa, or religious edict, on Rushdie in 1989, claiming his book The Satanic Verses blasphemed Islam.
 An Iranian foundation has added dlrs 300,000 to the reward for Salman Rushdie's death, just weeks after the Iranian government tried to distance itself from the bounty.
Mostafa Mirsalim, Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance, said at a press conference held last week that Iran will take the case of insulting religious sanctities like the Rushdie affair to the United Nations.
Since then, the Rushdie issue has turned into a big controversial problem that hinders the relations between Iran and European countries.
 The British government said Wednesday that it would continue to press Iran to lift the death sentence against the author Salman Rushdie when its foreign secretary, Robin Cook, meets the Iranian foreign minister in New York on Thursday.
Rushdie had spent nearly a decade in hiding since Khomeini issued the edict.
 Residents of a village in northern Iran have offered land and carpets to anyone who kills British author Salman Rushdie, a newspaper reported Sunday.
