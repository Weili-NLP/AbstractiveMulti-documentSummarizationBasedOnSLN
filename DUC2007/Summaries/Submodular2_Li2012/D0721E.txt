A jury has now convicted Aaron McKinney of murder, kidnapping and robbery in the case, and he could face the death penalty.
 Gay college student Matthew Shepard was pummeled to death by Aaron McKinney in a drunken, drug-induced rage after Shepard made a pass at him, McKinney's attorney said Monday as his trial began.
McKinney's co-defendant, Russell Henderson, pleaded guilty to kidnapping and felony murder in April and received life in prison.
Shepard, McKinney and Henderson met in a Laramie bar about a year ago, where Shepard asked McKinney for a ride home, humiliating him in front of friends because McKinney believed Shepard was gay, Tangeman contended.
Aaron McKinney, he pulled out a gun and told Matthew Shepard to give him his wallet, continued Henderson, who said that while he drove his friend beat Shepard.
Henderson has pleaded guilty to murder and kidnapping in the death of Shepard, a University of Wyoming student who was lured from a bar in October and fatally beaten.
Eight states have no hate crimes laws.
More than 4,000 people attended the march, which was billed as a political funeral to protest the killing of Matthew Shepard, 21, who died on Oct. 12 after being beaten and lashed to a fence in Wyoming in what the authorities called a bias-related crime.
Two young men, Aaron McKinney and Russell Henderson, are serving life sentences for the murder.
