In a lawsuit that goes to trial Monday, attorney Morris Dees of the Southern Poverty Law Center is representing a mother and son who were attacked by security guards for the white supremacist group.
This is nothing, Butler said.
 Issuing a verdict that civil rights organizations hope will bankrupt one of the nation's largest white-supremacist groups and limit its ability to preach hate, a state jury in northern Idaho Thursday ordered leaders of the Aryan Nations to pay more than $ 6 million to the victims of an attack two years ago by men who were serving as security guards at the group's compound near here.
The verdict was obtained by lawyers for the Southern Poverty Law Center, a nonprofit organization in Birmingham, Ala., that has successfully sued the Ku Klux Klan and other racist organizations.
 One of two men convicted of assaulting a woman and her son outside the headquarters of the Aryan Nations denied being a member of the white supremacist group Thursday during testimony in a civil rights case filed against them, the Aryan Nations and the group's founder, Richard Butler.
The plaintiffs, Victoria Keenan, now 44, and her son, Jason, now 21, who were beaten and shot at by three security guards for the Aryan Nations in July 1998, had asked the jury for nearly $ 12 million in compensatory and punitive damages.
HATE.
