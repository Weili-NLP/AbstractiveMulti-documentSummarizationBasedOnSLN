The mine is not in a world heritage listed area nor in a national park and it will cause neither environmental nor cultural damage, Hill said.
 The Australian federal government Thursday rejected a UNESCO report which called for Kakadu National Park in northwest Australia to be placed on the endangered list because of the threat posed by the Jabiluka uranium mine.
An eight-member team from the U.N.'s World Heritage Bureau will visit environmental and Aboriginal cultural sites and speak to interest groups including the company building the mine, Energy Resources of Australia Ltd..
 The Australian government will have until April 15 of next year to try to stop the United Nations from declaring Kakadu National Park endangered because of the Jabiluka uranium mine.
 Police arrested more than 100 protesters Tuesday at Energy Resources of Australia's Jabiluka mine development at Kakadu, a world heritage listed area in the Northern Territory.
Construction has begun at Jabiluka, where ERA has identified more than 90,000 metric tons of uranium oxide, making it one of the largest untapped high-grade uranium ore bodies in the world.
The report is due to go before the World Heritage Committee Bureau meeting in Kyoto.
About 200,000 tourists visit the park every year.
Australian Environment Minister Robert Hill said scientific evidence proved the natural values of Kakadu would not be threatened by the development of the mine.
The mine will add U.S. dlrs 3.7 billion Australian dollars 6.2 billion to Australia's gross domestic product over an about 30-year mine life, it says.
