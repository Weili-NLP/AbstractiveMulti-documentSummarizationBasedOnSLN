Foods that are least 50 percent organic could be labeled made with organic ingredients.
When a label says grown and processed in accordance with the California Organic Foods Act of 1990, it does not necessarily mean the food is truly organic, according to the organic foods industry, farmers, inspectors and others.
 New federal rules for organic food will assure consumers that the products are grown and processed to the same standards nationwide.
When the Agriculture Department proposed organic food regulations, more than 280,000 people filed comments protesting the inclusion of genetically modified foods as organic.
The department is developing the first national standards on organic food labeling to replace a hodgepodge of state rules and industry guidelines.
That does n't mean, however, that organic is better than conventional food, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said.
Sales of organic food have been increasing about 20 percent a year.
The Agriculture Department first proposed a set of national organic standards in 1997 but withdrew them after farmers and others in the $ 6 billion-a-year organic industry strongly objected to allowing biotech crops, irradiation and sewage sludge.
 Consumers once could find organic food products only in specialty stores.
The rules will allow products that meet the standards to carry a seal of approval that says, USDA Certified Organic.
Organic farming practices prohibit the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides for crops or antibiotics or hormones in livestock.
