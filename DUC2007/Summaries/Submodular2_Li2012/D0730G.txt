Clinton is the first president to have line-item veto authority.
 U.S. President Bill Clinton said Friday he will appeal a federal judge's ruling that struck down a law giving the president the power to veto specific items in bills passed by Congress.
 The U.S. Supreme Court Thursday struck down as unconstitutional the line-item veto law that lets the U.S. President strike out specific items in tax and spending measures.
 The Supreme Court ruled Thursday that Congress violated the principle of separation of powers when it gave the president the power to cut individual projects from tax and spending bills without vetoing the entire legislation.
Justice John Paul Stevens wrote the majority opinion for a court divided 6-to-3 in the line item veto case Clinton vs. City of New Article I, Section 7 of the U.S. Constitution : Every bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it becomes a law, be presented to the president of the United States ; if he approves he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, with objections to that House in which it shall have originated ... Returning a bill is a veto.
The line-item veto law was challenged by New York City and an Idaho potato growers group after provisions they sought were vetoed by President Bill Clinton.
But the court said Thursday that such line-item vetoes were unconstitutional.
Congress voted in 1996 to give the president such authority, and Clinton used the veto 82 times last year.
