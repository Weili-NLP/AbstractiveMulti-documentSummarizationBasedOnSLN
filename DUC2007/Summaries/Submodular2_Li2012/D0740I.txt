Pilots Brian Jones of England and Bertrand Piccard of Switzerland have flown further than any balloonist before, traveling more than 21,625 miles after leaving the Swiss Alps on March 1.
It will be Piccard's third attempt to become the first to pilot a balloon around the world nonstop.
 The Swiss and British balloonists aiming to be the first to circle the world nonstop floated over the Pacific Ocean Thursday after making it across China, their Geneva control center said.
The first two, Bertrand Piccard of Switzerland and Brian Jones of Britain, completed a 20-day trip together last March, ending in the Egyptian desert.
If the team makes it to North Africa, it will have traveled more than 26,000 miles around the world and Piccard and Jones will have conquered one of the last great challenges facing aviators.
The new Breitling Orbiter 3 balloon is to take off from Chateau d'Oex, a resort in the Swiss Alps, as soon as weather conditions are favorable.
With a second balloon team moving steadily along behind them, the British pair hope to pick up speed on the crossing to North America and in about two weeks time to become the first balloonists to fly nonstop around the world.
the team hopes to make it across and complete the round-the-world odyssey by Saturday or picked up after the Breitling Orbiter balloon found strong winds at 34,500 feet.
Unlike Piccard and Jones, though, Uliassi is flying in an unpressurized crew compartment.
