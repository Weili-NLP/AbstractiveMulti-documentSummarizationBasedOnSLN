The standard treatment is the drug interferon or a combination of interferon and ribavirin.
For 15 to 20 percent of people infected with hepatitis C, the virus simply goes away.
Until recently, interferon was the only treatment.
The virus is the leading cause of chronic liver disease.
After another six months had gone by, the virus was still undetectable in half of the combination patients, compared with just 5 percent in the interferon group.
Could these things cause hepatitis C?
Because of the risks of treatment, and its partial success rate, Hoofnagle said, doctors have tried to determine which patients truly need it rather than just giving the drugs to everyone with hepatitis C. Only 20 percent to 30 percent of people with chronic infections develop cirrhosis, liver failure or cancer.
Rebetron, made by the Schering-Plough Corp., was approved in June only for patients who had relapsed after taking interferon drugs, the only other approved treatment for the disease.
Hepatitis C is spread by blood and affects an estimated 3.9 million people in the United States.
All signs of the virus disappeared in 38 percent of patients who had been given both drugs for 11 months, compared with 13 percent of those treated with only interferon.
 The Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday approved a powerful combination of two antiviral drugs to treat chronic hepatitis C, a liver infection that can lead to cirrhosis, liver cancer and liver failure.
