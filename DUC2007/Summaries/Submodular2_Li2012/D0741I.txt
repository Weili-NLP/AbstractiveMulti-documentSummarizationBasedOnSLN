He committed suicide hours after a killing rampage in Atlanta left 12 people dead : nine people in two trading offices, plus his two children and his second wife.
Barton, a chemist and securities day trader, wrote in his letter that he killed his current wife, Leigh Ann, on Tuesday night and his two children, 11-year-old Matthew and 8-year-old Mychelle, on Wednesday night.
In a note left for authorities, Barton said he killed Leigh Ann on Tuesday and placed her body in a closet of her Stockbridge apartment.
But the securities firm where Barton began his shooting rampage disclosed Friday that he had lost $ 105,000 on 15 trading days the day he went home and killed his wife.
Four people were killed in that office.
Leigh Ann Barton took them in.
By that time, police had learned that Barton used a hammer to kill his estranged wife in her Stockbridge apartment on July 27 and to take the lives of their children Matthew, 11, and Mychelle, 8, the day before he packed his van with four pistols and set out for Buckhead.
All because of Mark Barton.
Delawalla and eight other people were shot to death at All-Tech and Momentum Securities, another day trading firm where Barton was a regular.
In a note left in the Stockbridge apartment where he killed his family, Barton wrote that he planned to live just long enough to kill ... the people that greedily sought my destruction.
