Myanmar is also known as Burma.
Since Sunday, the military has arrested more than 300 of members of Suu Kyi's political party, the National League for Democracy, to prevent it from convening the parliament elected in 1990.
SUU KYI : Very much so.
Thailand is a democratic country and the military government in Burma killed many people in 1988.
The military has ruled Myanmar, also known as Burma, since 1962.
 Myanmar's military government has detained another 187 members of pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi's party, bringing the total to 702 arrested since a crackdown began in May, the party said Friday.
 While Myanmar's military government continued its arrests of the country's democracy activists, a top general accused Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi of working with terrorists, state-run newspapers reported Thursday.
The NLD won 82 percent of the seats in parliament in a 1990 election the military refused to honor.
They should pressure Burma's military junta to enter a political dialogue with Suu Kyi, Burma's ethnic nationalities, and the National League for Democracy, the party elected overwhelmingly in 1990 but immediately denied its right to govern by the military.
There are 42 NLD members of parliament in Myanmar's prisons, according to the All Burma Students Democratic Front, an exile group.
The governments of Britain, France, West Germany and Japan have also condemned the arrests, as have human rights groups Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch Asia.
