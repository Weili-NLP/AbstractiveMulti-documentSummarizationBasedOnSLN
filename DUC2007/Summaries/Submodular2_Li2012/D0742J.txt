 A small plane carrying John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister disappeared late Friday off the Massachusetts coast, and by Saturday afternoon the authorities had recovered debris from the airplane off Martha's Vineyard.
The 38-year-old son of former President Kennedy was reported missing early Saturday on a flight from Essex County Airport in Fairfield, N.J. Also aboard the plane, which Kennedy was piloting, were his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and Lauren Bessette, her elder sister, according to officials and a family spokesman.
But as he headed for the small airport on Martha's Vineyard Friday night, John F. Kennedy Jr. knew where he was going.
Kennedy's Saratoga was almost new, the pilot said.
Kennedy was flying to Martha's Vineyard to drop off Lauren Bessette, after which he planned to fly to Hyannis to attend the wedding of his cousin Rory Kennedy.
NTSB officials released more information Monday from additional radar data received from a Nantucket airport that showed Kennedy's plane dropped 1,100 feet in only 14 seconds on that hazy Friday night as the plane flew about four miles southwest of Martha's Vineyard on its final approach to the island's airport.
 An employee of Martha's Vineyard Airport alerted federal aviation officials that John F. Kennedy Jr.'s plane was unaccounted for nearly four hours before a phone call from a Kennedy family friend early Saturday morning triggered a massive air and sea search.
