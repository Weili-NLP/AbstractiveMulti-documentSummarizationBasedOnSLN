This year Peru's mining companies planned to invest over 350 million U.S. dollars to increase gold production.
 Peru turned out 56.4 tons of gold in 1995, representing an increase of 18 percent over the previous year, the Energy and Mining Ministry said today.
Meilan added that from 1996 to 2000, the total investment in Argentina's mining sector would be around 3.5 billion U.S. dollars, which will help increase gold exports from 32 million to 1.3 billion dollars.
The line is to supply electricity to Brazil, Indian communities in Venezuela and gold mining companies that plan to come to Venezuela to extract some of the largest gold deposits in Latin America.
 Peru's gold output this year is expected to grow by 20.5 percent from last year to 92.6 tons, keeping Peru the eighth biggest gold manufacturing country in the world.
