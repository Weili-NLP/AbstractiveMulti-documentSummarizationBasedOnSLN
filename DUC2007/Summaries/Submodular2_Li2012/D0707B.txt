According to a Turkish Foreign Ministry statement, the European Union has taken up, during Monday's meeting, the situation between Turkey and Greece.
 Turkey said Wednesday it wants the European Union to make it a formal candidate for membership at its summit later this week.
 Turkey today welcomed the European Union's attitude toward its dispute with Greece and urged the EU to release financial assistance immediately despite Greek efforts to block it.
The European Parliament, angered by Turkey's human rights record, voted Thursday to freeze hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars in aid to Turkey for setting up a customs union with the EU.
Turkey, already a member country of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization NATO, signed an agreement on Customs Union with the EU in January 1996 and has been seeking an EU membership.
Finnish Foreign Minister Tarja Halonen, whose country is serving the rotating presidency of the European Union, and European Union Foreign Relations Commissioner Hans van den Broek are to meet in Ankara with Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit and Foreign Minister Ismail Cem.
Greece has said that it supports Turkey's European vocation but Ankara must improve both its human rights record and its relations with Athens.
 The U.S. government said today that the European Union EU should accept Turkey as its new member in the future.
 Greece threatened Thursday to react strongly if the European Commission's decision to release a 155 million-dollar package of economic aid to Turkey was approved by the European Union EU Council of Ministers.
