Federal agents also want to question him about similar bombings in Atlanta, including the bombing at Centennial Olympic Park in July 1996 that killed one and injured more than 100.
Rudolph's truck was seen leaving the area of the Birmingham bombing, and the fugitive disappeared Jan. 30 into the western North Carolina mountains.
 An old pickup truck federal investigators believe was stolen almost two weeks ago by Birmingham bomb suspect Eric Robert Rudolph was driven a few dozen miles over four days before it was abandoned in a remote Nantahala camp site, the head of the Southeast Bomb Task Force said Wednesday.
There have been no reported sighting of Rudolph since July 11, when health food store owner George Nordmann told authorities Rudolph had come to his home in nearby Nantahala and taken six months worth of food and supplies.
Rudolph had not been seen since Jan. 30, the day after the bombing of a Birmingham abortion clinic killed an off-duty police officer and severely injured a nurse.
All along, Enderson said, investigators have believed Rudolph was hiding in the mountains of western North Carolina.
 Federal officials said on Monday that there was no evidence linking Eric Robert Rudolph, the North Carolina fugitive charged in four Southern bombings, to an explosion outside an abortion clinic in Asheville, N.C., on Saturday morning.
Rudolph has been charged in three Atlanta-area bombings, including the 1996 Olympic park bombing in Atlanta, in which a woman died.
