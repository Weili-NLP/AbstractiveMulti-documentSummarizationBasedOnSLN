He said the ruling showed how no company is above the law.
The Justice Department says it will take over the case.
In his ruling, Federal District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson wrote that Microsoft violated the Sherman Antitrust Act.
 In its antitrust trial, the Microsoft Corp. is expected to introduce documents this week intended to contradict testimony by an IBM executive who said Microsoft would offer the computer maker a favorable price on its Windows operating system only if IBM agreed to eliminate or drop its competing operating system, OS/2.
The judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson of U.S. District Court, sided with the government on the most important points in its exhaustive antitrust suit, though he surprised lawyers on both sides by ruling for Microsoft in one area.
 Microsoft won a court appeal Tuesday today in part of the U.S. government l monopoly case against the computer giant, winning the right to tie its Internet software to its popular computer operating system.
The document was part of the public record from an older antitrust case against Microsoft, the Justice Department's first suit against the company.
It was on that issue that the federal appeals court in Washington overruled Jackson in an earlier phase of the company's battle with the government.
 The federal judge trying the Microsoft antitrust case agreed Thursday morning to delay his final ruling for about a week, giving the Justice Department time to reply to Microsoft's proposal, filed Wednesday, to revise the government's break up plan.
