Israel has accused Russia, China and North Korea of selling Iran technology and expertise for its arms program, including attempts to build nuclear weapons and missiles to carry them.
Meanwhile, reports reaching here said that Russian Minister of Atomic Energy Yevgeni Adamov on Wednesday also stressed that the nuclear cooperation between Russia and Iran centers on peaceful application of nuclear power.
Israel is believed to be the only Middle East country that has acquired nuclear capability.
Israel has long feared Iran's growing weapons program and warned of ties between Iran and Pakistan after last months nuclear testing by Pakistan and India.
U.S. officials repeatedly accused Tehran of seeking access to technology to produce nuclear weapons through building nuclear power plants.
 Senior Iranian officials on Monday assured Russia that Iran will use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and will pose no harm to any countries.
Iran's nuclear cooperation with Russia is fully for civilian application of nuclear energy and is taking place within the framework of international regulations, the Iranian official news agency IRNA quoted the spokesman as saying.
U.S. officials said that they were certain only that Wednesday's missile test was successful, and the missile tested was similar or perhaps identical to the Korean Rodong missile.
We have no idea what other countries in the region are doing, not Iran, Iraq or Israel, he said.
Russia is helping Iran build a 1,000-megawatt nuclear power plant in Bushehr, southern Iran.
