 Two Israelis who were arrested in Cyprus last week on suspicion of spying are agents of the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad, an Israeli newspaper said Thursday.
The two Israelis that were arrested in Cyprus did n't act against Cyprus and did n't act on Turkey's behalf, the statement said.
 The two Israelis arrested in Cyprus on suspicion of spying were not working for Israel, the Cypriot government said Sunday.
Cypriot police had said they suspected the Israelis were spying on behalf of Turkey, which invaded and occupied the northern third of Cyprus in 1974.
A statement released this week by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office was interpreted by Israeli media as a confirmation that two worked for Israel's Mossad.
The arrest came three days after Israeli President Ezer Weizman ended a three-day visit to the island.
Cypriot police officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Haaretz the two men were believed to be spying on behalf of Turkey, a military ally of Israel.
Haaretz has reported that the two men are agents of Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency, and that they were part of an intelligence operation near Ziyi.
Relations between Cyprus and Israel have chilled in recent months as Israel conducted joint military maneuvers with Turkey as part of their 1996 defense pact.
The suspects were caught with tapes of police conversations and surveillance devices near an army base on the Mediterranean island earlier this month.
